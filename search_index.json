If any vulnerabilities are found, then the impact and\nappropriate remediation will be calculated.  If the fix argument is\nprovided, then remediations will be applied to the package tree.\nThe command will exit with a 0 exit code if no vulnerabilities were found.\nNote that some vulnerabilities cannot be fixed automatically and will\nrequire manual intervention or review.  Also note that since npm audit\nfix runs a full-fledged npm install under the hood, all configs that\napply to the installer will also apply to npm install -- so things like\nnpm audit fix --package-lock-only will work as expected.\nBy default, the audit command will exit with a non-zero code if any\nvulnerability is found. It may be useful in CI environments to include the\n--audit-level parameter to specify the minimum vulnerability level that\nwill cause the command to fail. This option does not filter the report\noutput, it simply changes the command's failure threshold.\nAudit Endpoints\nThere are two audit endpoints that npm may use to fetch vulnerability\ninformation: the Bulk Advisory endpoint and the Quick Audit endpoint.\nBulk Advisory Endpoint\nAs of version 7, npm uses the much faster Bulk Advisory endpoint to\noptimize the speed of calculating audit results.\nnpm will generate a JSON payload with the name and list of versions of each\npackage in the tree, and POST it to the default configured registry at\nthe path /-/npm/v1/security/advisories/bulk.\nAny packages in the tree that do not have a version field in their\npackage.json file will be ignored.  If any --omit options are specified\n(either via the --omit config, or one of the shorthands such as\n--production, --only=dev, and so on), then packages will be omitted\nfrom the submitted payload as appropriate.\nIf the registry responds with an error, or with an invalid response, then\nnpm will attempt to load advisory data from the Quick Audit endpoint.\nThe expected result will contain a set of advisory objects for each\ndependency that matches the advisory range.  Each advisory object contains\na name, url, id, severity, vulnerable_versions, and title.\nnpm then uses these advisory objects to calculate vulnerabilities and\nmeta-vulnerabilities of the dependencies within the tree.\nQuick Audit Endpoint\nIf the Bulk Advisory endpoint returns an error, or invalid data, npm will\nattempt to load advisory data from the Quick Audit endpoint, which is\nconsiderably slower in most cases.\nThe full package tree as found in package-lock.json is submitted, along\nwith the following pieces of additional metadata:\n\nnpm_version\nnode_version\nplatform\narch\nnode_env\n\nAll packages in the tree are submitted to the Quick Audit endpoint.\nOmitted dependency types are skipped when generating the report.\nScrubbing\nOut of an abundance of caution, npm versions 5 and 6 would \"scrub\" any\npackages from the submitted report if their name contained a / character,\nso as to avoid leaking the names of potentially private packages or git\nURLs.\nHowever, in practice, this resulted in audits often failing to properly\ndetect meta-vulnerabilities, because the tree would appear to be invalid\ndue to missing dependencies, and prevented the detection of vulnerabilities\nin package trees that used git dependencies or private modules.\nThis scrubbing has been removed from npm as of version 7.\nCalculating Meta-Vulnerabilities and Remediations\nnpm uses the\n@npmcli/metavuln-calculator\nmodule to turn a set of security advisories into a set of \"vulnerability\"\nobjects.  A \"meta-vulnerability\" is a dependency that is vulnerable by\nvirtue of dependence on vulnerable versions of a vulnerable package.\nFor example, if the package foo is vulnerable in the range `>=1.0.2\n, and the packagebardepends onfoo@^1.1.0, then that version\nofbarcan only be installed by installing a vulnerable version offoo.\nIn this case,bar` is a \"metavulnerability\".\nOnce metavulnerabilities for a given package are calculated, they are\ncached in the ~/.npm folder and only re-evaluated if the advisory range\nchanges, or a new version of the package is published (in which case, the\nnew version is checked for metavulnerable status as well).\nIf the chain of metavulnerabilities extends all the way to the root\nproject, and it cannot be updated without changing its dependency ranges,\nthen npm audit fix will require the --force option to apply the\nremediation.  If remediations do not require changes to the dependency\nranges, then all vulnerable packages will be updated to a version that does\nnot have an advisory or metavulnerability posted against it.\nExit Code\nThe npm audit command will exit with a 0 exit code if no vulnerabilities\nwere found.  The npm audit fix command will exit with 0 exit code if no\nvulnerabilities are found or if the remediation is able to successfully\nfix all vulnerabilities.\nIf vulnerabilities were found the exit code will depend on the\naudit-level configuration setting.\nExamples\nScan your project for vulnerabilities and automatically install any compatible\nupdates to vulnerable dependencies:\n$ npm audit fix\n\nRun audit fix without modifying node_modules, but still updating the\npkglock:\n$ npm audit fix --package-lock-only\n\nSkip updating devDependencies:\n$ npm audit fix --only=prod\n\nHave audit fix install SemVer-major updates to toplevel dependencies, not\njust SemVer-compatible ones:\n$ npm audit fix --force\n\nDo a dry run to get an idea of what audit fix will do, and also output\ninstall information in JSON format:\n$ npm audit fix --dry-run --json\n\nScan your project for vulnerabilities and just show the details, without\nfixing anything:\n$ npm audit\n\nGet the detailed audit report in JSON format:\n$ npm audit --json\n\nFail an audit only if the results include a vulnerability with a level of moderate or higher:\n$ npm audit --audit-level=moderate\n\nSee Also\n\nnpm install\nconfig\n\n"},"commands/npm-bin.html":{"url":"commands/npm-bin.html","title":"Npm Bin","summary":"Display npm bin folder","keywords":"","body":"Synopsis\nnpm bin [-g|--global]\n\nNote: This command is unaware of workspaces.\nDescription\nPrint the folder where npm will install executables.\nSee Also\n\nnpm prefix\nnpm root\nnpm folders\nnpm config\nnpmrc\n\n"},"commands/npm-bugs.html":{"url":"commands/npm-bugs.html","title":"Npm Bugs","summary":"Report bugs for a package in a web browser","keywords":"","body":"Synopsis\nnpm bugs [ [ ...]]\n\naliases: issues\n\nDescription\nThis command tries to guess at the likely location of a package's bug\ntracker URL or the mailto URL of the support email, and then tries to\nopen it using the --browser config param.

This directory is a\ncacache-based content-addressable cache that\nstores all http request data as well as other package-related data. This\ndirectory is primarily accessed through pacote, the library responsible\nfor all package fetching as of npm@5.\nAll data that passes through the cache is fully verified for integrity on\nboth insertion and extraction. Cache corruption will either trigger an\nerror, or signal to pacote that the data must be refetched, which it will\ndo automatically. For this reason, it should never be necessary to clear\nthe cache for any reason other than reclaiming disk space, thus why clean\nnow requires --force to run.\nThere is currently no method exposed through npm to inspect or directly\nmanage the contents of this cache. In order to access it, cacache must be\nused directly.\nnpm will not remove data by itself: the cache will grow as new packages are\ninstalled.\nA note about the cache's design\nThe npm cache is strictly a cache: it should not be relied upon as a\npersistent and reliable data store for package data. npm makes no guarantee\nthat a previously-cached piece of data will be available later, and will\nautomatically delete corrupted contents. The primary guarantee that the\ncache makes is that, if it does return data, that data will be exactly the\ndata that was inserted.\nTo run an offline verification of existing cache contents, use npm cache\nverify.\nConfiguration\ncache\nDefault: ~/.npm on Posix, or %AppData%/npm-cache on Windows.\nThe root cache folder.\nSee Also\n\nnpm folders\nnpm config\nnpmrc\nnpm install\nnpm publish\nnpm pack\nhttps://npm.im/cacache\nhttps://npm.im/pacote\nhttps://npm.im/@npmcli/arborist\nhttps://npm.im/make-fetch-happen\n\n"},"commands/npm-ci.html":{"url":"commands/npm-ci.html","title":"Npm Ci","summary":"Install a project with a clean slate","keywords":"","body":"Synopsis\nnpm ci\n\nDescription\nThis command is similar to npm install, except\nit's meant to be used in automated environments such as test platforms,\ncontinuous integration, and deployment -- or any situation where you want\nto make sure you're doing a clean install of your dependencies.\nnpm ci will be significantly faster when:\n\nThere is a package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json file.\nThe node_modules folder is missing or empty.\n\nIn short, the main differences between using npm install and npm ci are:\n\nThe project must have an existing package-lock.json or\nnpm-shrinkwrap.json.\nIf dependencies in the package lock do not match those in package.json,\nnpm ci will exit with an error, instead of updating the package lock.\nnpm ci can only install entire projects at a time: individual\ndependencies cannot be added with this command.\nIf a node_modules is already present, it will be automatically removed\nbefore npm ci begins its install.\nIt will never write to package.json or any of the package-locks:\ninstalls are essentially frozen.\n\nExample\nMake sure you have a package-lock and an up-to-date install:\n$ cd ./my/npm/project\n$ npm install\nadded 154 packages in 10s\n$ ls | grep package-lock\n\nRun npm ci in that project\n$ npm ci\nadded 154 packages in 5s\n\nConfigure Travis to build using npm ci instead of npm install:\n# .travis.yml\ninstall:\n- npm ci\n# keep the npm cache around to speed up installs\ncache:\n  directories:\n  - \"$HOME/.npm\"\n\nSee Also\n\nnpm install\npackage-lock.json\n\n"},"commands/npm-completion.html":{"url":"commands/npm-completion.html","title":"Npm Completion","summary":"Tab Completion for npm","keywords":"","body":"Synopsis\nsource \nNote: This command is unaware of workspaces.\nDescription\nEnables tab-completion in all npm commands.\nThe synopsis above\nloads the completions into your current shell.

Many\nissues are often attributable to things that are outside npm's code base,\nso npm doctor confirms that the npm installation is in a good state.\nAlso, in addition to this, there are also very many issue reports due to\nusing old versions of npm. Since npm is constantly improving, running\nnpm@latest is better than an old version.\nnpm doctor verifies the following items in your environment, and if there\nare any recommended changes, it will display them.\nnpm ping\nBy default, npm installs from the primary npm registry,\nregistry.npmjs.org.  npm doctor hits a special ping endpoint within the\nregistry. This can also be checked with npm ping. If this check fails,\nyou may be using a proxy that needs to be configured, or may need to talk\nto your IT staff to get access over HTTPS to registry.npmjs.org.\nThis check is done against whichever registry you've configured (you can\nsee what that is by running npm config get registry), and if you're using\na private registry that doesn't support the /whoami endpoint supported by\nthe primary registry, this check may fail.\nnpm -v\nWhile Node.js may come bundled with a particular version of npm, it's the\npolicy of the CLI team that we recommend all users run npm@latest if they\ncan. As the CLI is maintained by a small team of contributors, there are\nonly resources for a single line of development, so npm's own long-term\nsupport releases typically only receive critical security and regression\nfixes. The team believes that the latest tested version of npm is almost\nalways likely to be the most functional and defect-free version of npm.\nnode -v\nFor most users, in most circumstances, the best version of Node will be the\nlatest long-term support (LTS) release. Those of you who want access to new\nECMAscript features or bleeding-edge changes to Node's standard library may\nbe running a newer version, and some may be required to run an older\nversion of Node because of enterprise change control policies. That's OK!\nBut in general, the npm team recommends that most users run Node.js LTS.\nnpm config get registry\nYou may be installing from private package registries for your project or\ncompany. That's great! Others may be following tutorials or StackOverflow\nquestions in an effort to troubleshoot problems you may be having.\nSometimes, this may entail changing the registry you're pointing at.  This\npart of npm doctor just lets you, and maybe whoever's helping you with\nsupport, know that you're not using the default registry.\nwhich git\nWhile it's documented in the README, it may not be obvious that npm needs\nGit installed to do many of the things that it does.

Interactive mode is not supported in CI\nenvironments when standard input is a TTY, to prevent hangs.\nWhatever packages are specified by the --package option will be\nprovided in the PATH of the executed command, along with any locally\ninstalled package executables.  The --package option may be\nspecified multiple times, to execute the supplied command in an environment\nwhere all specified packages are available.\nIf any requested packages are not present in the local project\ndependencies, then they are installed to a folder in the npm cache, which\nis added to the PATH environment variable in the executed process.  A\nprompt is printed (which can be suppressed by providing either --yes or\n--no).\nPackage names provided without a specifier will be matched with whatever\nversion exists in the local project.  Package names with a specifier will\nonly be considered a match if they have the exact same name and version as\nthe local dependency.\nIf no -c or --call option is provided, then the positional arguments\nare used to generate the command string.  If no --package options\nare provided, then npm will attempt to determine the executable name from\nthe package specifier provided as the first positional argument according\nto the following heuristic:\n\nIf the package has a single entry in its bin field in package.json,\nor if all entries are aliases of the same command, then that command\nwill be used.\nIf the package has multiple bin entries, and one of them matches the\nunscoped portion of the name field, then that command will be used.\nIf this does not result in exactly one option (either because there are\nno bin entries, or none of them match the name of the package), then\nnpm exec exits with an error.\n\nTo run a binary other than the named binary, specify one or more\n--package options, which will prevent npm from inferring the package from\nthe first command argument.\nnpx vs npm exec\nWhen run via the npx binary, all flags and options must be set prior to\nany positional arguments.  When run via npm exec, a double-hyphen --\nflag can be used to suppress npm's parsing of switches and options that\nshould be sent to the executed command.\nFor example:\n$ npx foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo\nIn this case, npm will resolve the foo package name, and run the\nfollowing command:\n$ foo bar --package=@npmcli/foo\nSince the --package option comes after the positional arguments, it is\ntreated as an argument to the executed command.\nIn contrast, due to npm's argument parsing logic, running this command is\ndifferent:\n$ npm exec foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo\nIn this case, npm will parse the --package option first, resolving the\n@npmcli/foo package.  Then, it will execute the following command in that\ncontext:\n$ foo@latest bar\nThe double-hyphen character is recommended to explicitly tell npm to stop\nparsing command line options and switches.  The following command would\nthus be equivalent to the npx command above:\n$ npm exec -- foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo\nExamples\nRun the version of tap in the local dependencies, with the provided\narguments:\n$ npm exec -- tap --bail test/foo.js\n$ npx tap --bail test/foo.js\nRun a command other than the command whose name matches the package name\nby specifying a --package option:\n$ npm exec --package=foo -- bar --bar-argument\n# ~ or ~\n$ npx --package=foo bar --bar-argument\nRun an arbitrary shell script, in the context of the current project:\n$ npm x -c 'eslint && say \"hooray, lint passed\"'\n$ npx -c 'eslint && say \"hooray, lint passed\"'\nWorkspaces support\nYou may use the workspace or workspaces configs in order to run an\narbitrary command from an npm package (either one installed locally, or fetched\nremotely) in the context of the specified workspaces.\nIf no positional argument or --call option is provided, it will open an\ninteractive subshell in the context of each of these configured workspaces one\nat a time.\nGiven a project with configured workspaces, e.g:\n.\n+-- package.json\n`-- packages\n   +-- a\n   |   `-- package.json\n   +-- b\n   |   `-- package.json\n   `-- c\n       `-- package.json\nAssuming the workspace configuration is properly set up at the root level\npackage.json file. e.g:\n{\n    \"workspaces\": [ \"./packages/*\" ]\n}\nYou can execute an arbitrary command from a package in the context of each of\nthe configured workspaces when using the workspaces configuration options,\nin this example we're using eslint to lint any js file found within each\nworkspace folder:\nnpm exec --ws -- eslint ./*.js\nFiltering workspaces\nIt's also possible to execute a command in a single workspace using the\nworkspace config along with a name or directory path:\nnpm exec --workspace=a -- eslint ./*.js\nThe workspace config can also be specified multiple times in order to run a\nspecific script in the context of multiple workspaces. When defining values for\nthe workspace config in the command line, it also possible to use -w as a\nshorthand, e.g:\nnpm exec -w a -w b -- eslint ./*.js\nThis last command will run the eslint command in both ./packages/a and\n./packages/b folders.\nCompatibility with Older npx Versions\nThe npx binary was rewritten in npm v7.0.0, and the standalone npx\npackage deprecated at that time.  npx uses the npm exec\ncommand instead of a separate argument parser and install process, with\nsome affordances to maintain backwards compatibility with the arguments it\naccepted in previous versions.\nThis resulted in some shifts in its functionality:\n\nAny npm config value may be provided.\nTo prevent security and user-experience problems from mistyping package\nnames, npx prompts before installing anything.  Suppress this\nprompt with the -y or --yes option.\nThe --no-install option is deprecated, and will be converted to --no.\nShell fallback functionality is removed, as it is not advisable.\nThe -p argument is a shorthand for --parseable in npm, but shorthand\nfor --package in npx.  This is maintained, but only for the npx\nexecutable.\nThe --ignore-existing option is removed.  Locally installed bins are\nalways present in the executed process PATH.\nThe --npm option is removed.  npx will always use the npm it ships\nwith.\nThe --node-arg and -n options are removed.\nThe --always-spawn option is redundant, and thus removed.\nThe --shell option is replaced with --script-shell, but maintained\nin the npx executable for backwards compatibility.\n\nA note on caching\nThe npm cli utilizes its internal package cache when using the package\nname specified.

Many of the configuration\nparams have some effect on installation, since that's most of what npm\ndoes.\nThese are some of the most common options related to installation.\nConfiguration Options Affecting Dependency Resolution And Tree Design\n\n-g or --global: install the package globally rather than locally.\nSee folders.\n\n--global-style: install the package into your local node_modules\nfolder with the same layout it uses with the global node_modules\nfolder. Only your direct dependencies will show in node_modules and\neverything they depend on will be flattened in their node_modules\nfolders. This obviously will eliminate some deduping.\n\n--legacy-bundling: install the package in the style of versions of npm\nprior to 1.4, where dependencies are not automatically deduped up to the\nshallowest level in the tree possible.  This is extremely\ndisk-inefficient.\n\n--legacy-peer-deps: ignore all peerDependencies when installing, in\nthe style of npm version 4 through version 6.\n\n--strict-peer-deps: fail and abort the install process for any\nconflicting peerDependencies when encountered.  By default, npm will only\ncrash for peerDependencies conflicts caused by the direct dependencies of\nthe root project.\n\n--no-package-lock (alias: --no-shrinkwrap): do not read the\nlockfile (package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json) for the intended\npackage tree, and do not save the resulting package tree back to a\nlockfile.\n\n\nOmitting Dependency Types\nYou may omit certain types of dependencies by using the --omit=\nconfig option.  This may be specified multiple types on the command line.\nTo enter omit options in .npmrc files, use the following syntax:\nomit[] = dev\nomit[] = optional\n; etc...\n\nThe dependency types that may be omitted or included are:\n\npeer: any peerDependencies, including those with a\npeerDependenciesMeta entry specifying optional: true\noptional: dependencies listed in optionalDependencies\ndev: dependencies listed in devDependencies\n\nTo re-include dependency, use the --include option, which may also be\nspecified multiple times.\nLegacy shorthands for omit settings are:\n\n--no-optional: prevent optionalDependencies from being installed.  Note\nthat their presence is still entered in the package-lock.json file, and\nthe tree is designed such that they can be installed in the future.\n\n--prod: prevent devDependencies from being installed.\n\n--only=prod: omit devDependencies\n\n--also=dev: include devDependencies\n\n\nConfiguration Options Affecting Build Process\n\n--ignore-scripts: do not execute any scripts defined in the\npackage.json. See scripts.\n\n--no-audit: disable sending audit reports to the configured registries.\nSee npm-audit for details on what is sent.\n\n--no-bin-links: prevent npm from creating symlinks for any binaries the\npackage might contain.\n\n--no-fund: suppress the message displayed at the end of each install\nthat acknowledges the number of dependencies looking for funding.  See\nnpm-fund\n\n--dry-run: Do not actually install anything into the node_modules\nfolder.  Just build the intended tree in memory, and report on it.\n\n--no-save: Do not save installed dependencies to package.json or\npackage-lock.json.\n\n\nAlgorithm\nGiven a package{dep} structure: A{B,C}, B{C}, C{D},\nthe npm install algorithm produces:\nA\n+-- B\n+-- C\n+-- D\n\nThat is, the dependency from B to C is satisfied by the fact that A already\ncaused C to be installed at a higher level. D is still installed at the top\nlevel because nothing conflicts with it.\nFor A{B,C}, B{C,D@1}, C{D@2}, this algorithm produces:\nA\n+-- B\n+-- C\n   `-- D@2\n+-- D@1\n\nBecause B's D@1 will be installed in the top-level, C now has to install\nD@2 privately for itself. This algorithm is deterministic, but different\ntrees may be produced if two dependencies are requested for installation in\na different order.\nSee folders for a more detailed description of\nthe specific folder structures that npm creates.\nSee Also\n\nnpm folders\nnpm update\nnpm audit\nnpm fund\nnpm link\nnpm rebuild\nnpm scripts\nnpm config\nnpmrc\nnpm registry\nnpm dist-tag\nnpm uninstall\nnpm shrinkwrap\npackage.json\nworkspaces\n\n"},"commands/npm-link.html":{"url":"commands/npm-link.html","title":"Npm Link","summary":"Symlink a package folder","keywords":"","body":"Synopsis\nnpm link (in package dir)\nnpm link [/][@]\n\nalias: npm ln\n\nDescription\nThis is handy for installing your own stuff, so that you can work on it and\ntest iteratively without having to continually rebuild.\nPackage linking is a two-step process.\nFirst, npm link in a package folder will create a symlink in the global\nfolder {prefix}/lib/node_modules/ that links to the package\nwhere the npm link command was executed. It will also link any bins in\nthe package to {prefix}/bin/{name}.  Note that npm link uses the global\nprefix (see npm prefix -g for its value).\nNext, in some other location, npm link package-name will create a\nsymbolic link from globally-installed package-name to node_modules/ of\nthe current folder.\nNote that package-name is taken from package.json, not from the\ndirectory name.\nThe package name can be optionally prefixed with a scope. See\nscope.  The scope must be preceded by an @-symbol and\nfollowed by a slash.\nWhen creating tarballs for npm publish, the linked packages are\n\"snapshotted\" to their current state by resolving the symbolic links, if\nthey are included in bundleDependencies.\nFor example:\ncd ~/projects/node-redis    # go into the package directory\nnpm link                    # creates global link\ncd ~/projects/node-bloggy   # go into some other package directory.\nnpm link redis              # link-install the package\n\nNow, any changes to ~/projects/node-redis will be reflected in\n~/projects/node-bloggy/node_modules/node-redis/. Note that the link\nshould be to the package name, not the directory name for that package.\nYou may also shortcut the two steps in one.  For example, to do the\nabove use-case in a shorter way:\ncd ~/projects/node-bloggy  # go into the dir of your main project\nnpm link ../node-redis     # link the dir of your dependency\n\nThe second line is the equivalent of doing:\n(cd ../node-redis; npm link)\nnpm link redis\n\nThat is, it first creates a global link, and then links the global\ninstallation target into your project's node_modules folder.\nNote that in this case, you are referring to the directory name,\nnode-redis, rather than the package name redis.\nIf your linked package is scoped (see scope) your\nlink command must include that scope, e.g.\nnpm link @myorg/privatepackage\n\nCaveat\nNote that package dependencies linked in this way are not saved to\npackage.json by default, on the assumption that the intention is to have\na link stand in for a regular non-link dependency.  Otherwise, for example,\nif you depend on redis@^3.0.1, and ran npm link redis, it would replace\nthe ^3.0.1 dependency with file:../path/to/node-redis, which you\nprobably don't want!  Additionally, other users or developers on your\nproject would run into issues if they do not have their folders set up\nexactly the same as yours.\nIf you are adding a new dependency as a link, you should add it to the\nrelevant metadata by running npm install  --package-lock-only.\nIf you want to save the file: reference in your package.json and\npackage-lock.json files, you can use npm link  --save to do so.\nSee Also\n\nnpm developers\npackage.json\nnpm install\nnpm folders\nnpm config\nnpmrc\n\n"},"commands/npm-logout.html":{"url":"commands/npm-logout.html","title":"Npm Logout","summary":"Log out of the registry","keywords":"","body":"Synopsis\nnpm logout [--registry=] [--scope=]\n\nNote: This command is unaware of workspaces.\nDescription\nWhen logged into a registry that supports token-based authentication, tell\nthe server to end this token's session.

In\nsuch a case, the logical dependency graph and physical tree of packages on\ndisk would be roughly identical.\nWith the advent of automatic install-time deduplication of dependencies in\nnpm v3, the ls output was modified to display the logical dependency\ngraph as a tree structure, since this was more useful to most users.\nHowever, without using npm ls -l, it became impossible show where a\npackage was actually installed much of the time!\nWith the advent of automatic installation of peerDependencies in npm v7,\nthis gets even more curious, as peerDependencies are logically\n\"underneath\" their dependents in the dependency graph, but are always\nphysically at or above their location on disk.\nAlso, in the years since npm got an ls command (in version 0.0.2!),\ndependency graphs have gotten much larger as a general rule.  Therefore, in\norder to avoid dumping an excessive amount of content to the terminal, npm\nls now only shows the top level dependencies, unless --all is\nprovided.\nA thorough re-examination of the use cases, intention, behavior, and output\nof this command, is currently underway.

Also, if the --scripts-prepend-node-path is\npassed, the directory within which node resides is added to the PATH.\nIf --scripts-prepend-node-path=auto is passed (which has been the default\nin npm v3), this is only performed when that node executable is not\nfound in the PATH.\nIf you try to run a script without having a node_modules directory and it\nfails, you will be given a warning to run npm install, just in case you've\nforgotten.\nWorkspaces support\nYou may use the workspace or workspaces configs in order to run an\narbitrary command from a package's \"scripts\" object in the context of the\nspecified workspaces.

It puts\nmodules in place so that node can find them, and manages dependency\nconflicts intelligently.\nIt is extremely configurable to support a variety of use cases.  Most\ncommonly, you use it to publish, discover, install, and develop node\nprograms.\nRun npm help to get a list of available commands.\nImportant\nnpm comes preconfigured to use npm's public registry at\nhttps://registry.npmjs.org by default. Use of the npm public registry is\nsubject to terms of use available at\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms.\nYou can configure npm to use any compatible registry you like, and even\nrun your own registry. Use of someone else's registry is governed by\ntheir terms of use.\nIntroduction\nYou probably got npm because you want to install stuff.\nThe very first thing you will most likely want to run in any node\nprogram is npm install to install its dependencies.\nYou can also run npm install blerg to install the latest version of\n\"blerg\".  Check out npm install for more\ninfo.  It can do a lot of stuff.\nUse the npm search command to show everything that's available in the\npublic registry.  Use npm ls to show everything you've installed.\nDependencies\nIf a package lists a dependency using a git URL, npm will install that\ndependency using the git\ncommand and will generate an error if it is not installed.\nIf one of the packages npm tries to install is a native node module and\nrequires compiling of C++ Code, npm will use\nnode-gyp for that task.\nFor a Unix system, node-gyp\nneeds Python, make and a buildchain like GCC. On Windows,\nPython and Microsoft Visual Studio C++ are needed. Python 3 is\nnot supported by node-gyp.\nFor more information visit\nthe node-gyp repository and\nthe node-gyp Wiki.\nDirectories\nSee folders to learn about where npm puts\nstuff.\nIn particular, npm has two modes of operation:\n\nlocal mode:\nnpm installs packages into the current project directory, which\ndefaults to the current working directory.  Packages install to\n./node_modules, and bins to ./node_modules/.bin.\nglobal mode:\nnpm installs packages into the install prefix at\n$npm_config_prefix/lib/node_modules and bins to\n$npm_config_prefix/bin.\n\nLocal mode is the default.  Use -g or --global on any command to\nrun in global mode instead.\nDeveloper Usage\nIf you're using npm to develop and publish your code, check out the\nfollowing help topics:\n\njson:\nMake a package.json file.  See\npackage.json.\nlink:\nLinks your current working code into Node's path, so that you don't\nhave to reinstall every time you make a change.  Use npm\nlink to do this.\ninstall:\nIt's a good idea to install things if you don't need the symbolic\nlink.  Especially, installing other peoples code from the registry is\ndone via npm install\nadduser:\nCreate an account or log in.  When you do this, npm will store\ncredentials in the user config file config file.\npublish:\nUse the npm publish command to upload your\ncode to the registry.\n\nConfiguration\nnpm is extremely configurable.  It reads its configuration options from\n5 places.\n\nCommand line switches:\nSet a config with --key val.  All keys take a value, even if they\nare booleans (the config parser doesn't know what the options are at\nthe time of parsing).  If you do not provide a value (--key) then\nthe option is set to boolean true.\nEnvironment Variables:\nSet any config by prefixing the name in an environment variable with\nnpm_config_.  For example, export npm_config_key=val.\nUser Configs:\nThe file at $HOME/.npmrc is an ini-formatted list of configs.  If\npresent, it is parsed.  If the userconfig option is set in the cli\nor env, that file will be used instead.\nGlobal Configs:\nThe file found at ./etc/npmrc (relative to the global prefix will be\nparsed if it is found.  See npm prefix for\nmore info on the global prefix.  If the globalconfig option is set\nin the cli, env, or user config, then that file is parsed instead.\nDefaults:\nnpm's default configuration options are defined in\nlib/utils/config-defs.js.  These must not be changed.\n\nSee config for much much more information.\nContributions\nPatches welcome!\nIf you would like to help, but don't know what to work on, read the\ncontributing\nguidelines and\ncheck the issues list.\nBugs\nWhen you find issues, please report them:\nhttps://github.com/npm/cli/issues\nPlease be sure to follow the template and bug reporting guidelines.\nFeature Requests\nDiscuss new feature ideas on our discussion forum:\n\nhttps://github.com/npm/feedback\n\nOr suggest formal RFC proposals:\n\nhttps://github.com/npm/rfcs\n\nSee Also\n\nnpm help\npackage.json\nnpmrc\nnpm config\nnpm install\nnpm prefix\nnpm publish\n\n"},"commands/npx.html":{"url":"commands/npx.html","title":"Npx","summary":"Run a command from a local or remote npm package","keywords":"","body":"Synopsis\nnpm exec -- [@] [args...]\nnpm exec --package=[@] --  [args...]\nnpm exec -c ' [args...]'\nnpm exec --package=foo -c ' [args...]'\n\nnpx [@] [args...]\nnpx -p [@]  [args...]\nnpx -c ' [args...]'\nnpx -p [@] -c ' [args...]'\n\nalias: npm x, npx\n\n--package= (may be specified multiple times)\n-p is a shorthand for --package only when using npx executable\n-c  --call= (may not be mixed with positional arguments)\n\nDescription\nThis command allows you to run an arbitrary command from an npm package\n(either one installed locally, or fetched remotely), in a similar context\nas running it via npm run.\nWhatever packages are specified by the --package option will be\nprovided in the PATH of the executed command, along with any locally\ninstalled package executables.  The --package option may be\nspecified multiple times, to execute the supplied command in an environment\nwhere all specified packages are available.\nIf any requested packages are not present in the local project\ndependencies, then they are installed to a folder in the npm cache, which\nis added to the PATH environment variable in the executed process.  A\nprompt is printed (which can be suppressed by providing either --yes or\n--no).\nPackage names provided without a specifier will be matched with whatever\nversion exists in the local project.  Package names with a specifier will\nonly be considered a match if they have the exact same name and version as\nthe local dependency.\nIf no -c or --call option is provided, then the positional arguments\nare used to generate the command string.  If no --package options\nare provided, then npm will attempt to determine the executable name from\nthe package specifier provided as the first positional argument according\nto the following heuristic:\n\nIf the package has a single entry in its bin field in package.json,\nor if all entries are aliases of the same command, then that command\nwill be used.\nIf the package has multiple bin entries, and one of them matches the\nunscoped portion of the name field, then that command will be used.\nIf this does not result in exactly one option (either because there are\nno bin entries, or none of them match the name of the package), then\nnpm exec exits with an error.\n\nTo run a binary other than the named binary, specify one or more\n--package options, which will prevent npm from inferring the package from\nthe first command argument.\nnpx vs npm exec\nWhen run via the npx binary, all flags and options must be set prior to\nany positional arguments.  When run via npm exec, a double-hyphen --\nflag can be used to suppress npm's parsing of switches and options that\nshould be sent to the executed command.\nFor example:\n$ npx foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo\nIn this case, npm will resolve the foo package name, and run the\nfollowing command:\n$ foo bar --package=@npmcli/foo\nSince the --package option comes after the positional arguments, it is\ntreated as an argument to the executed command.\nIn contrast, due to npm's argument parsing logic, running this command is\ndifferent:\n$ npm exec foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo\nIn this case, npm will parse the --package option first, resolving the\n@npmcli/foo package.  Then, it will execute the following command in that\ncontext:\n$ foo@latest bar\nThe double-hyphen character is recommended to explicitly tell npm to stop\nparsing command line options and switches.  The following command would\nthus be equivalent to the npx command above:\n$ npm exec -- foo@latest bar --package=@npmcli/foo\nExamples\nRun the version of tap in the local dependencies, with the provided\narguments:\n$ npm exec -- tap --bail test/foo.js\n$ npx tap --bail test/foo.js\nRun a command other than the command whose name matches the package name\nby specifying a --package option:\n$ npm exec --package=foo -- bar --bar-argument\n# ~ or ~\n$ npx --package=foo bar --bar-argument\nRun an arbitrary shell script, in the context of the current project:\n$ npm x -c 'eslint && say \"hooray, lint passed\"'\n$ npx -c 'eslint && say \"hooray, lint passed\"'\nCompatibility with Older npx Versions\nThe npx binary was rewritten in npm v7.0.0, and the standalone npx\npackage deprecated at that time.  npx uses the npm exec\ncommand instead of a separate argument parser and install process, with\nsome affordances to maintain backwards compatibility with the arguments it\naccepted in previous versions.\nThis resulted in some shifts in its functionality:\n\nAny npm config value may be provided.\nTo prevent security and user-experience problems from mistyping package\nnames, npx prompts before installing anything.  Suppress this\nprompt with the -y or --yes option.\nThe --no-install option is deprecated, and will be converted to --no.\nShell fallback functionality is removed, as it is not advisable.\nThe -p argument is a shorthand for --parseable in npm, but shorthand\nfor --package in npx.  This is maintained, but only for the npx\nexecutable.\nThe --ignore-existing option is removed.  Locally installed bins are\nalways present in the executed process PATH.\nThe --npm option is removed.  npx will always use the npm it ships\nwith.\nThe --node-arg and -n options are removed.\nThe --always-spawn option is redundant, and thus removed.\nThe --shell option is replaced with --script-shell, but maintained\nin the npx executable for backwards compatibility.\n\nSee Also\n\nnpm run-script\nnpm scripts\nnpm test\nnpm start\nnpm restart\nnpm stop\nnpm config\n\n"},"configuring-npm/folders.html":{"url":"configuring-npm/folders.html","title":"Folders","summary":"Folder Structures Used by npm","keywords":"","body":"Description\nnpm puts various things on your computer.  That's its job.\nThis document will tell you what it puts where.\ntl;dr\n\nLocal install (default): puts stuff in ./node_modules of the current\npackage root.\nGlobal install (with -g): puts stuff in /usr/local or wherever node\nis installed.\nInstall it locally if you're going to require() it.\nInstall it globally if you're going to run it on the command line.\nIf you need both, then install it in both places, or use npm link.\n\nprefix Configuration\nThe prefix config defaults to the location where node is installed.\nOn most systems, this is /usr/local. On Windows, it's %AppData%\\npm.\nOn Unix systems, it's one level up, since node is typically installed at\n{prefix}/bin/node rather than {prefix}/node.exe.\nWhen the global flag is set, npm installs things into this prefix.\nWhen it is not set, it uses the root of the current package, or the\ncurrent working directory if not in a package already.\nNode Modules\nPackages are dropped into the node_modules folder under the prefix.\nWhen installing locally, this means that you can\nrequire(\"packagename\") to load its main module, or\nrequire(\"packagename/lib/path/to/sub/module\") to load other modules.\nGlobal installs on Unix systems go to {prefix}/lib/node_modules.\nGlobal installs on Windows go to {prefix}/node_modules (that is, no\nlib folder.)\nScoped packages are installed the same way, except they are grouped together\nin a sub-folder of the relevant node_modules folder with the name of that\nscope prefix by the @ symbol, e.g. npm install @myorg/package would place\nthe package in {prefix}/node_modules/@myorg/package. See scope for more details.\nIf you wish to require() a package, then install it locally.\nExecutables\nWhen in global mode, executables are linked into {prefix}/bin on Unix,\nor directly into {prefix} on Windows.\nWhen in local mode, executables are linked into\n./node_modules/.bin so that they can be made available to scripts run\nthrough npm.  (For example, so that a test runner will be in the path\nwhen you run npm test.)\nMan Pages\nWhen in global mode, man pages are linked into {prefix}/share/man.\nWhen in local mode, man pages are not installed.\nMan pages are not installed on Windows systems.\nCache\nSee npm cache.  Cache files are stored in ~/.npm on Posix, or\n%AppData%/npm-cache on Windows.\nThis is controlled by the cache configuration param.\nTemp Files\nTemporary files are stored by default in the folder specified by the\ntmp config, which defaults to the TMPDIR, TMP, or TEMP environment\nvariables, or /tmp on Unix and c:\\windows\\temp on Windows.\nTemp files are given a unique folder under this root for each run of the\nprogram, and are deleted upon successful exit.\nMore Information\nWhen installing locally, npm first tries to find an appropriate\nprefix folder.  This is so that npm install foo@1.2.3 will install\nto the sensible root of your package, even if you happen to have cded\ninto some other folder.\nStarting at the $PWD, npm will walk up the folder tree checking for a\nfolder that contains either a package.json file, or a node_modules\nfolder.  If such a thing is found, then that is treated as the effective\n\"current directory\" for the purpose of running npm commands.  (This\nbehavior is inspired by and similar to git's .git-folder seeking\nlogic when running git commands in a working dir.)\nIf no package root is found, then the current folder is used.\nWhen you run npm install foo@1.2.3, then the package is loaded into\nthe cache, and then unpacked into ./node_modules/foo.  Then, any of\nfoo's dependencies are similarly unpacked into\n./node_modules/foo/node_modules/....\nAny bin files are symlinked to ./node_modules/.bin/, so that they may\nbe found by npm scripts when necessary.\nGlobal Installation\nIf the global configuration is set to true, then npm will\ninstall packages \"globally\".\nFor global installation, packages are installed roughly the same way,\nbut using the folders described above.\nCycles, Conflicts, and Folder Parsimony\nCycles are handled using the property of node's module system that it\nwalks up the directories looking for node_modules folders.  So, at every\nstage, if a package is already installed in an ancestor node_modules\nfolder, then it is not installed at the current location.\nConsider the case above, where foo -> bar -> baz.  Imagine if, in\naddition to that, baz depended on bar, so you'd have:\nfoo -> bar -> baz -> bar -> baz ....  However, since the folder\nstructure is: foo/node_modules/bar/node_modules/baz, there's no need to\nput another copy of bar into .../baz/node_modules, since when it calls\nrequire(\"bar\"), it will get the copy that is installed in\nfoo/node_modules/bar.\nThis shortcut is only used if the exact same\nversion would be installed in multiple nested node_modules folders.  It\nis still possible to have a/node_modules/b/node_modules/a if the two\n\"a\" packages are different versions.  However, without repeating the\nexact same package multiple times, an infinite regress will always be\nprevented.\nAnother optimization can be made by installing dependencies at the\nhighest level possible, below the localized \"target\" folder.\nExample\nConsider this dependency graph:\nfoo\n+-- blerg@1.2.5\n+-- bar@1.2.3\n|   +-- blerg@1.x (latest=1.3.7)\n|   +-- baz@2.x\n|   |   `-- quux@3.x\n|   |       `-- bar@1.2.3 (cycle)\n|   `-- asdf@*\n`-- baz@1.2.3\n    `-- quux@3.x\n        `-- bar\n\nIn this case, we might expect a folder structure like this:\nfoo\n+-- node_modules\n    +-- blerg (1.2.5) \nSince foo depends directly on bar@1.2.3 and baz@1.2.3, those are\ninstalled in foo's node_modules folder.\nEven though the latest copy of blerg is 1.3.7, foo has a specific\ndependency on version 1.2.5.  So, that gets installed at [A].  Since the\nparent installation of blerg satisfies bar's dependency on blerg@1.x,\nit does not install another copy under [B].\nBar [B] also has dependencies on baz and asdf, so those are installed in\nbar's node_modules folder.  Because it depends on baz@2.x, it cannot\nre-use the baz@1.2.3 installed in the parent node_modules folder [D],\nand must install its own copy [C].\nUnderneath bar, the baz -> quux -> bar dependency creates a cycle.\nHowever, because bar is already in quux's ancestry [B], it does not\nunpack another copy of bar into that folder.\nUnderneath foo -> baz [D], quux's [E] folder tree is empty, because its\ndependency on bar is satisfied by the parent folder copy installed at [B].\nFor a graphical breakdown of what is installed where, use npm ls.\nPublishing\nUpon publishing, npm will look in the node_modules folder.  If any of\nthe items there are not in the bundledDependencies array, then they will\nnot be included in the package tarball.\nThis allows a package maintainer to install all of their dependencies\n(and dev dependencies) locally, but only re-publish those items that\ncannot be found elsewhere.

If you want to provide only a\nurl, you can specify the value for \"bugs\" as a simple string instead of an\nobject.\nIf a url is provided, it will be used by the npm bugs command.\nlicense\nYou should specify a license for your package so that people know how they\nare permitted to use it, and any restrictions you're placing on it.\nIf you're using a common license such as BSD-2-Clause or MIT, add a current\nSPDX license identifier for the license you're using, like this:\n{\n  \"license\" : \"BSD-3-Clause\"\n}\n\nYou can check the full list of SPDX license\nIDs.  Ideally you should pick one that is\nOSI approved.\nIf your package is licensed under multiple common licenses, use an SPDX\nlicense expression syntax version 2.0\nstring, like this:\n{\n  \"license\" : \"(ISC OR GPL-3.0)\"\n}\n\nIf you are using a license that hasn't been assigned an SPDX identifier, or if\nyou are using a custom license, use a string value like this one:\n{\n  \"license\" : \"SEE LICENSE IN \"\n}\n\nThen include a file named  at the top level of the package.\nSome old packages used license objects or a \"licenses\" property containing\nan array of license objects:\n// Not valid metadata\n{\n  \"license\" : {\n    \"type\" : \"ISC\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Not valid metadata\n{\n  \"licenses\" : [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"MIT\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"Apache-2.0\",\n      \"url\": \"https://opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThose styles are now deprecated.

A\n\"person\" is an object with a \"name\" field and optionally \"url\" and \"email\",\nlike this:\n{\n  \"name\" : \"Barney Rubble\",\n  \"email\" : \"b@rubble.com\",\n  \"url\" : \"http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/\"\n}\n\nOr you can shorten that all into a single string, and npm will parse it for\nyou:\n{\n  \"author\": \"Barney Rubble  (http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/)\"\n}\n\nBoth email and url are optional either way.\nnpm also sets a top-level \"maintainers\" field with your npm user info.\nfunding\nYou can specify an object containing an URL that provides up-to-date\ninformation about ways to help fund development of your package, or a\nstring URL, or an array of these:\n{\n  \"funding\": {\n    \"type\" : \"individual\",\n    \"url\" : \"http://example.com/donate\"\n  },\n\n  \"funding\": {\n    \"type\" : \"patreon\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://www.patreon.com/my-account\"\n  },\n\n  \"funding\": \"http://example.com/donate\",\n\n  \"funding\": [\n    {\n      \"type\" : \"individual\",\n      \"url\" : \"http://example.com/donate\"\n    },\n    \"http://example.com/donateAlso\",\n    {\n      \"type\" : \"patreon\",\n      \"url\" : \"https://www.patreon.com/my-account\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nUsers can use the npm fund subcommand to list the funding URLs of all\ndependencies of their project, direct and indirect. A shortcut to visit\neach funding url is also available when providing the project name such as:\nnpm fund  (when there are multiple URLs, the first one will\nbe visited)\nfiles\nThe optional files field is an array of file patterns that describes the\nentries to be included when your package is installed as a dependency. File\npatterns follow a similar syntax to .gitignore, but reversed: including a\nfile, directory, or glob pattern (*, **/*, and such) will make it so\nthat file is included in the tarball when it's packed. Omitting the field\nwill make it default to [\"*\"], which means it will include all files.\nSome special files and directories are also included or excluded regardless\nof whether they exist in the files array (see below).\nYou can also provide a .npmignore file in the root of your package or in\nsubdirectories, which will keep files from being included. At the root of\nyour package it will not override the \"files\" field, but in subdirectories\nit will. The .npmignore file works just like a .gitignore. If there is\na .gitignore file, and .npmignore is missing, .gitignore's contents\nwill be used instead.\nFiles included with the \"package.json#files\" field cannot be excluded\nthrough .npmignore or .gitignore.\nCertain files are always included, regardless of settings:\n\npackage.json\nREADME\nCHANGES / CHANGELOG / HISTORY\nLICENSE / LICENCE\nNOTICE\nThe file in the \"main\" field\n\nREADME, CHANGES, LICENSE & NOTICE can have any case and extension.\nConversely, some files are always ignored:\n\n.git\nCVS\n.svn\n.hg\n.lock-wscript\n.wafpickle-N\n.*.swp\n.DS_Store\n._*\nnpm-debug.log\n.npmrc\nnode_modules\nconfig.gypi\n*.orig\npackage-lock.json (use\nnpm-shrinkwrap.json if you wish\nit to be published)\n\nmain\nThe main field is a module ID that is the primary entry point to your\nprogram.  That is, if your package is named foo, and a user installs it,\nand then does require(\"foo\"), then your main module's exports object will\nbe returned.\nThis should be a module relative to the root of your package folder.\nFor most modules, it makes the most sense to have a main script and often\nnot much else.\nIf main is not set it defaults to index.js in the packages root folder.\nbrowser\nIf your module is meant to be used client-side the browser field should be\nused instead of the main field. This is helpful to hint users that it might\nrely on primitives that aren't available in Node.js modules. (e.g.\nwindow)\nbin\nA lot of packages have one or more executable files that they'd like to\ninstall into the PATH. npm makes this pretty easy (in fact, it uses this\nfeature to install the \"npm\" executable.)\nTo use this, supply a bin field in your package.json which is a map of\ncommand name to local file name. On install, npm will symlink that file\ninto prefix/bin for global installs, or ./node_modules/.bin/ for local\ninstalls.\nFor example, myapp could have this:\n{\n  \"bin\": {\n    \"myapp\": \"./cli.js\"\n  }\n}\n\nSo, when you install myapp, it'll create a symlink from the cli.js script\nto /usr/local/bin/myapp.\nIf you have a single executable, and its name should be the name of the\npackage, then you can just supply it as a string.  For example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-program\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.5\",\n  \"bin\": \"./path/to/program\"\n}\n\nwould be the same as this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-program\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.5\",\n  \"bin\": {\n    \"my-program\": \"./path/to/program\"\n  }\n}\n\nPlease make sure that your file(s) referenced in bin starts with\n#!/usr/bin/env node, otherwise the scripts are started without the node\nexecutable!\nNote that you can also set the executable files using directories.bin.\nman\nSpecify either a single file or an array of filenames to put in place for\nthe man program to find.\nIf only a single file is provided, then it's installed such that it is the\nresult from man , regardless of its actual filename.  For\nexample:\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"description\": \"A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos\",\n  \"main\": \"foo.js\",\n  \"man\": \"./man/doc.1\"\n}\n\nwould link the ./man/doc.1 file in such that it is the target for man\nfoo\nIf the filename doesn't start with the package name, then it's prefixed.\nSo, this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"description\": \"A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos\",\n  \"main\": \"foo.js\",\n  \"man\": [\n    \"./man/foo.1\",\n    \"./man/bar.1\"\n  ]\n}\n\nwill create files to do man foo and man foo-bar.\nMan files must end with a number, and optionally a .gz suffix if they are\ncompressed.  The number dictates which man section the file is installed\ninto.\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"description\": \"A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos\",\n  \"main\": \"foo.js\",\n  \"man\": [\n    \"./man/foo.1\",\n    \"./man/foo.2\"\n  ]\n}\n\nwill create entries for man foo and man 2 foo\ndirectories\nThe CommonJS Packages spec\ndetails a few ways that you can indicate the structure of your package\nusing a directories object. If you look at npm's\npackage.json, you'll see that it\nhas directories for doc, lib, and man.\nIn the future, this information may be used in other creative ways.\ndirectories.bin\nIf you specify a bin directory in directories.bin, all the files in\nthat folder will be added.\nBecause of the way the bin directive works, specifying both a bin path\nand setting directories.bin is an error. If you want to specify\nindividual files, use bin, and for all the files in an existing bin\ndirectory, use directories.bin.\ndirectories.man\nA folder that is full of man pages.  Sugar to generate a \"man\" array by\nwalking the folder.\nrepository\nSpecify the place where your code lives. This is helpful for people who\nwant to contribute.  If the git repo is on GitHub, then the npm docs\ncommand will be able to find you.\nDo it like this:\n{\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/npm/cli.git\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe URL should be a publicly available (perhaps read-only) url that can be\nhanded directly to a VCS program without any modification.  It should not\nbe a url to an html project page that you put in your browser.  It's for\ncomputers.\nFor GitHub, GitHub gist, Bitbucket, or GitLab repositories you can use the\nsame shortcut syntax you use for npm install:\n{\n  \"repository\": \"npm/npm\",\n\n  \"repository\": \"github:user/repo\",\n\n  \"repository\": \"gist:11081aaa281\",\n\n  \"repository\": \"bitbucket:user/repo\",\n\n  \"repository\": \"gitlab:user/repo\"\n}\n\nIf the package.json for your package is not in the root directory (for\nexample if it is part of a monorepo), you can specify the directory in\nwhich it lives:\n{\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/facebook/react.git\",\n    \"directory\": \"packages/react-dom\"\n  }\n}\n\nscripts\nThe \"scripts\" property is a dictionary containing script commands that are\nrun at various times in the lifecycle of your package.  The key is the\nlifecycle event, and the value is the command to run at that point.\nSee scripts to find out more about writing package\nscripts.\nconfig\nA \"config\" object can be used to set configuration parameters used in\npackage scripts that persist across upgrades.  For instance, if a package\nhad the following:\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"config\": {\n    \"port\": \"8080\"\n  }\n}\n\nand then had a \"start\" command that then referenced the\nnpm_package_config_port environment variable, then the user could\noverride that by doing npm config set foo:port 8001.\nSee config and scripts for\nmore on package configs.\ndependencies\nDependencies are specified in a simple object that maps a package name to a\nversion range. The version range is a string which has one or more\nspace-separated descriptors.  Dependencies can also be identified with a\ntarball or git URL.\nPlease do not put test harnesses or transpilers or other \"development\"\ntime tools in your dependencies object.  See devDependencies, below.\nSee semver for more details about specifying version ranges.\n\nversion Must match version exactly\n>version Must be greater than version\n>=version etc\n\n\n~version \"Approximately equivalent to version\"  See\nsemver\n^version \"Compatible with version\"  See semver\n1.2.x 1.2.0, 1.2.1, etc., but not 1.3.0\nhttp://... See 'URLs as Dependencies' below\n* Matches any version\n\"\" (just an empty string) Same as *\nversion1 - version2 Same as >=version1 .\nrange1 || range2 Passes if either range1 or range2 are satisfied.\ngit... See 'Git URLs as Dependencies' below\nuser/repo See 'GitHub URLs' below\ntag A specific version tagged and published as tag  See npm\ndist-tag\npath/path/path See Local Paths below\n\nFor example, these are all valid:\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"foo\": \"1.0.0 - 2.9999.9999\",\n    \"bar\": \">=1.0.2 1.0.2 =2.3.1 =2.5.2 \nURLs as Dependencies\nYou may specify a tarball URL in place of a version range.\nThis tarball will be downloaded and installed locally to your package at\ninstall time.\nGit URLs as Dependencies\nGit urls are of the form:\n://[[:]@][:][:][/][# | #semver:]\n\n is one of git, git+ssh, git+http, git+https, or\ngit+file.\nIf # is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that\ncommit. If the commit-ish has the format #semver:,  can\nbe any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for any tags\nor refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as it would for\na registry dependency. If neither # or #semver: is\nspecified, then master is used.\nExamples:\ngit+ssh://git@github.com:npm/cli.git#v1.0.27\ngit+ssh://git@github.com:npm/cli#semver:^5.0\ngit+https://isaacs@github.com/npm/cli.git\ngit://github.com/npm/cli.git#v1.0.27\n\nGitHub URLs\nAs of version 1.1.65, you can refer to GitHub urls as just \"foo\":\n\"user/foo-project\".  Just as with git URLs, a commit-ish suffix can be\nincluded.  For example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"expressjs/express\",\n    \"mocha\": \"mochajs/mocha#4727d357ea\",\n    \"module\": \"user/repo#feature\\/branch\"\n  }\n}\n\nLocal Paths\nAs of version 2.0.0 you can provide a path to a local directory that\ncontains a package. Local paths can be saved using npm install -S or npm\ninstall --save, using any of these forms:\n../foo/bar\n~/foo/bar\n./foo/bar\n/foo/bar\n\nin which case they will be normalized to a relative path and added to your\npackage.json. For example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"baz\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"bar\": \"file:../foo/bar\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis feature is helpful for local offline development and creating tests\nthat require npm installing where you don't want to hit an external server,\nbut should not be used when publishing packages to the public registry.\ndevDependencies\nIf someone is planning on downloading and using your module in their\nprogram, then they probably don't want or need to download and build the\nexternal test or documentation framework that you use.\nIn this case, it's best to map these additional items in a\ndevDependencies object.\nThese things will be installed when doing npm link or npm install from\nthe root of a package, and can be managed like any other npm configuration\nparam.  See config for more on the topic.\nFor build steps that are not platform-specific, such as compiling\nCoffeeScript or other languages to JavaScript, use the prepare script to\ndo this, and make the required package a devDependency.\nFor example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"ethopia-waza\",\n  \"description\": \"a delightfully fruity coffee varietal\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"coffee-script\": \"~1.6.3\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"prepare\": \"coffee -o lib/ -c src/waza.coffee\"\n  },\n  \"main\": \"lib/waza.js\"\n}\n\nThe prepare script will be run before publishing, so that users can\nconsume the functionality without requiring them to compile it themselves.\nIn dev mode (ie, locally running npm install), it'll run this script as\nwell, so that you can test it easily.\npeerDependencies\nIn some cases, you want to express the compatibility of your package with a\nhost tool or library, while not necessarily doing a require of this host.\nThis is usually referred to as a plugin. Notably, your module may be\nexposing a specific interface, expected and specified by the host\ndocumentation.\nFor example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"tea-latte\",\n  \"version\": \"1.3.5\",\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"tea\": \"2.x\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis ensures your package tea-latte can be installed along with the\nsecond major version of the host package tea only. npm install\ntea-latte could possibly yield the following dependency graph:\n├── tea-latte@1.3.5\n└── tea@2.2.0\n\nIn npm versions 3 through 6, peerDependencies were not automatically\ninstalled, and would raise a warning if an invalid version of the peer\ndependency was found in the tree.  As of npm v7, peerDependencies are\ninstalled by default.\nTrying to install another plugin with a conflicting requirement may cause\nan error if the tree cannot be resolved correctly. For this reason, make\nsure your plugin requirement is as broad as possible, and not to lock it\ndown to specific patch versions.\nAssuming the host complies with semver, only changes\nin the host package's major version will break your plugin. Thus, if you've\nworked with every 1.x version of the host package, use \"^1.0\" or \"1.x\"\nto express this. If you depend on features introduced in 1.5.2, use\n\"^1.5.2\".\npeerDependenciesMeta\nWhen a user installs your package, npm will emit warnings if packages\nspecified in peerDependencies are not already installed. The\npeerDependenciesMeta field serves to provide npm more information on how\nyour peer dependencies are to be used. Specifically, it allows peer\ndependencies to be marked as optional.\nFor example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"tea-latte\",\n  \"version\": \"1.3.5\",\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"tea\": \"2.x\",\n    \"soy-milk\": \"1.2\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependenciesMeta\": {\n    \"soy-milk\": {\n      \"optional\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nMarking a peer dependency as optional ensures npm will not emit a warning\nif the soy-milk package is not installed on the host. This allows you to\nintegrate and interact with a variety of host packages without requiring\nall of them to be installed.\nbundledDependencies\nThis defines an array of package names that will be bundled when publishing\nthe package.\nIn cases where you need to preserve npm packages locally or have them\navailable through a single file download, you can bundle the packages in a\ntarball file by specifying the package names in the bundledDependencies\narray and executing npm pack.\nFor example:\nIf we define a package.json like this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"awesome-web-framework\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"bundledDependencies\": [\n    \"renderized\",\n    \"super-streams\"\n  ]\n}\n\nwe can obtain awesome-web-framework-1.0.0.tgz file by running npm pack.\nThis file contains the dependencies renderized and super-streams which\ncan be installed in a new project by executing npm install\nawesome-web-framework-1.0.0.tgz.  Note that the package names do not\ninclude any versions, as that information is specified in dependencies.\nIf this is spelled \"bundleDependencies\", then that is also honored.\noptionalDependencies\nIf a dependency can be used, but you would like npm to proceed if it cannot\nbe found or fails to install, then you may put it in the\noptionalDependencies object.  This is a map of package name to version or\nurl, just like the dependencies object.  The difference is that build\nfailures do not cause installation to fail.  Running npm install\n--no-optional will prevent these dependencies from being installed.\nIt is still your program's responsibility to handle the lack of the\ndependency.  For example, something like this:\ntry {\n  var foo = require('foo')\n  var fooVersion = require('foo/package.json').version\n} catch (er) {\n  foo = null\n}\nif ( notGoodFooVersion(fooVersion) ) {\n  foo = null\n}\n\n// .. then later in your program ..\n\nif (foo) {\n  foo.doFooThings()\n}\n\nEntries in optionalDependencies will override entries of the same name in\ndependencies, so it's usually best to only put in one place.\nengines\nYou can specify the version of node that your stuff works on:\n{\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \">=0.10.3 \nAnd, like with dependencies, if you don't specify the version (or if you\nspecify \"*\" as the version), then any version of node will do.\nYou can also use the \"engines\" field to specify which versions of npm are\ncapable of properly installing your program.  For example:\n{\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"npm\": \"~1.0.20\"\n  }\n}\n\nUnless the user has set the engine-strict config flag, this field is\nadvisory only and will only produce warnings when your package is installed\nas a dependency.\nos\nYou can specify which operating systems your\nmodule will run on:\n{\n  \"os\": [\n    \"darwin\",\n    \"linux\"\n  ]\n}\n\nYou can also block instead of allowing operating systems, just prepend the\nblocked os with a '!':\n{\n  \"os\": [\n    \"!win32\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThe host operating system is determined by process.platform\nIt is allowed to both block and allow an item, although there isn't any\ngood reason to do this.\ncpu\nIf your code only runs on certain cpu architectures,\nyou can specify which ones.\n{\n  \"cpu\": [\n    \"x64\",\n    \"ia32\"\n  ]\n}\n\nLike the os option, you can also block architectures:\n{\n  \"cpu\": [\n    \"!arm\",\n    \"!mips\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThe host architecture is determined by process.arch\nprivate\nIf you set \"private\": true in your package.json, then npm will refuse to\npublish it.\nThis is a way to prevent accidental publication of private repositories.\nIf you would like to ensure that a given package is only ever published to\na specific registry (for example, an internal registry), then use the\npublishConfig dictionary described below to override the registry\nconfig param at publish-time.\npublishConfig\nThis is a set of config values that will be used at publish-time. It's\nespecially handy if you want to set the tag, registry or access, so that\nyou can ensure that a given package is not tagged with \"latest\", published\nto the global public registry or that a scoped module is private by\ndefault.\nSee config to see the list of config options that\ncan be overridden.\nworkspaces\nThe optional workspaces field is an array of file patterns that describes\nlocations within the local file system that the install client should look\nup to find each workspace that needs to be\nsymlinked to the top level node_modules folder.\nIt can describe either the direct paths of the folders to be used as\nworkspaces or it can define globs that will resolve to these same folders.\nIn the following example, all folders located inside the folder\n./packages will be treated as workspaces as long as they have valid\npackage.json files inside them:\n{\n  \"name\": \"workspace-example\",\n  \"workspaces\": [\n    \"./packages/*\"\n  ]\n}\n\nSee workspaces for more examples.\nDEFAULT VALUES\nnpm will default some values based on package contents.\n\n\"scripts\": {\"start\": \"node server.js\"}\nIf there is a server.js file in the root of your package, then npm will\ndefault the start command to node server.js.\n\n\"scripts\":{\"install\": \"node-gyp rebuild\"}\nIf there is a binding.gyp file in the root of your package and you have\nnot defined an install or preinstall script, npm will default the\ninstall command to compile using node-gyp.\n\n\"contributors\": [...]\nIf there is an AUTHORS file in the root of your package, npm will treat\neach line as a Name  (url) format, where email and url are\noptional.  Lines which start with a # or are blank, will be ignored.\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nsemver\nworkspaces\nnpm init\nnpm version\nnpm config\nnpm help\nnpm install\nnpm publish\nnpm uninstall\n\n"},"configuring-npm/package-lock-json.html":{"url":"configuring-npm/package-lock-json.html","title":"package-lock.json","summary":"A manifestation of the manifest","keywords":"","body":"Description\npackage-lock.json is automatically generated for any operations where npm\nmodifies either the node_modules tree, or package.json. It describes the\nexact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to\ngenerate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.\nThis file is intended to be committed into source repositories, and serves\nvarious purposes:\n\nDescribe a single representation of a dependency tree such that\nteammates, deployments, and continuous integration are guaranteed to\ninstall exactly the same dependencies.\n\nProvide a facility for users to \"time-travel\" to previous states of\nnode_modules without having to commit the directory itself.\n\nFacilitate greater visibility of tree changes through readable source\ncontrol diffs.\n\nOptimize the installation process by allowing npm to skip repeated\nmetadata resolutions for previously-installed packages.\n\nAs of npm v7, lockfiles include enough information to gain a complete\npicture of the package tree, reducing the need to read package.json\nfiles, and allowing for significant performance improvements.\n\n\npackage-lock.json vs npm-shrinkwrap.json\nBoth of these files have the same format, and perform similar functions in\nthe root of a project.\nThe difference is that package-lock.json is that it cannot be published,\nand it will be ignored if found in any place other than the root project.\nIn contrast, npm-shrinkwrap.json allows\npublication, and defines the dependency tree from the point encountered.\nThis is not recommended unless deploying a CLI tool or otherwise using the\npublication process for producing production packages.\nIf both package-lock.json and npm-shrinkwrap.json are present in the\nroot of a project, npm-shrinkwrap.json will take precedence and\npackage-lock.json will be ignored.\nHidden Lockfiles\nIn order to avoid processing the node_modules folder repeatedly, npm as\nof v7 uses a \"hidden\" lockfile present in\nnode_modules/.package-lock.json.  This contains information about the\ntree, and is used in lieu of reading the entire node_modules hierarchy\nprovided that the following conditions are met:\n\nAll package folders it references exist in the node_modules hierarchy.\nNo package folders exist in the node_modules hierarchy that are not\nlisted in the lockfile.\nThe modified time of the file is at least as recent as all of the package\nfolders it references.\n\nThat is, the hidden lockfile will only be relevant if it was created as\npart of the most recent update to the package tree.  If another CLI mutates\nthe tree in any way, this will be detected, and the hidden lockfile will be\nignored.\nNote that it is possible to manually change the contents of a package\nin such a way that the modified time of the package folder is unaffected.\nFor example, if you add a file to node_modules/foo/lib/bar.js, then the\nmodified time on node_modules/foo will not reflect this change.  If you\nare manually editing files in node_modules, it is generally best to\ndelete the file at node_modules/.package-lock.json.\nAs the hidden lockfile is ignored by older npm versions, it does not\ncontain the backwards compatibility affordances present in \"normal\"\nlockfiles.  That is, it is lockfileVersion: 3, rather than\nlockfileVersion: 2.\nHandling Old Lockfiles\nWhen npm detects a lockfile from npm v6 or before during the package\ninstallation process, it is automatically updated to fetch missing\ninformation from either the node_modules tree or (in the case of empty\nnode_modules trees or very old lockfile formats) the npm registry.\nFile Format\nname\nThe name of the package this is a package-lock for. This will match what's\nin package.json.\nversion\nThe version of the package this is a package-lock for. This will match\nwhat's in package.json.\nlockfileVersion\nAn integer version, starting at 1 with the version number of this\ndocument whose semantics were used when generating this\npackage-lock.json.\nNote that the file format changed significantly in npm v7 to track\ninformation that would have otherwise required looking in node_modules or\nthe npm registry.  Lockfiles generated by npm v7 will contain\nlockfileVersion: 2.\n\nNo version provided: an \"ancient\" shrinkwrap file from a version of npm\nprior to npm v5.\n1: The lockfile version used by npm v5 and v6.\n2: The lockfile version used by npm v7, which is backwards compatible\nto v1 lockfiles.\n3: The lockfile version used by npm v7, without backwards\ncompatibility affordances.  This is used for the hidden lockfile at\nnode_modules/.package-lock.json, and will likely be used in a future\nversion of npm, once support for npm v6 is no longer relevant.\n\nnpm will always attempt to get whatever data it can out of a lockfile, even\nif it is not a version that it was designed to support.\npackages\nThis is an object that maps package locations to an object containing the\ninformation about that package.\nThe root project is typically listed with a key of \"\", and all other\npackages are listed with their relative paths from the root project folder.\nPackage descriptors have the following fields:\n\nversion: The version found in package.json\n\nresolved: The place where the package was actually resolved from.  In\nthe case of packages fetched from the registry, this will be a url to a\ntarball.  In the case of git dependencies, this will be the full git url\nwith commit sha.  In the case of link dependencies, this will be the\nlocation of the link target.\n\nintegrity: A sha512 or sha1 Standard Subresource\nIntegrity\nstring for the artifact that was unpacked in this location.\n\nlink: A flag to indicate that this is a symbolic link.  If this is\npresent, no other fields are specified, since the link target will also\nbe included in the lockfile.\n\ndev, optional, devOptional: If the package is strictly part of the\ndevDependencies tree, then dev will be true.  If it is strictly part\nof the optionalDependencies tree, then optional will be set.  If it\nis both a dev dependency and an optional dependency of a non-dev\ndependency, then devOptional will be set.  (An optional dependency of\na dev dependency will have both dev and optional set.)\n\ninBundle: A flag to indicate that the package is a bundled dependency.\n\nhasInstallScript: A flag to indicate that the package has a preinstall,\ninstall, or postinstall script.\n\nhasShrinkwrap: A flag to indicate that the package has an\nnpm-shrinkwrap.json file.\n\nbin, license, engines, dependencies, optionalDependencies: fields from\npackage.json\n\n\ndependencies\nLegacy data for supporting versions of npm that use lockfileVersion: 1.\nThis is a mapping of package names to dependency objects.

If the tarball URL isn't on the same server as the\nregistry URL then this is a complete URL.\n\nbundled:  If true, this is the bundled dependency and will be installed\nby the parent module.  When installing, this module will be extracted\nfrom the parent module during the extract phase, not installed as a\nseparate dependency.\n\ndev: If true then this dependency is either a development dependency ONLY\nof the top level module or a transitive dependency of one.  This is false\nfor dependencies that are both a development dependency of the top level\nand a transitive dependency of a non-development dependency of the top\nlevel.\n\noptional: If true then this dependency is either an optional dependency\nONLY of the top level module or a transitive dependency of one.

For example:\nca=\"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\\nXXXX\\nXXXX\\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\"\n\nSet to null to only allow \"known\" registrars, or to a specific CA cert to\ntrust only that specific signing authority.\nMultiple CAs can be trusted by specifying an array of certificates:\nca[]=\"...\"\nca[]=\"...\"\n\nSee also the strict-ssl config.\ncache\n\nDefault: Windows: %LocalAppData%\\npm-cache, Posix: ~/.npm\nType: Path\n\nThe location of npm's cache directory. See npm\ncache\ncafile\n\nDefault: null\nType: Path\n\nA path to a file containing one or multiple Certificate Authority signing\ncertificates. Similar to the ca setting, but allows for multiple CA's, as\nwell as for the CA information to be stored in a file on disk.\ncall\n\nDefault: \"\"\nType: String\n\nOptional companion option for npm exec, npx that allows for specifying a\ncustom command to be run along with the installed packages.\nnpm exec --package yo --package generator-node --call \"yo node\"\n\ncert\n\nDefault: null\nType: null or String\n\nA client certificate to pass when accessing the registry. Values should be\nin PEM format (Windows calls it \"Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)\") with\nnewlines replaced by the string \"\\n\".

Only your\ndirect dependencies will show in node_modules and everything they depend\non will be flattened in their node_modules folders. This obviously will\neliminate some deduping. If used with legacy-bundling, legacy-bundling\nwill be preferred.\nglobalconfig\n\nDefault: The global --prefix setting plus 'etc/npmrc'. For example,\n'/usr/local/etc/npmrc'\nType: Path\n\nThe config file to read for global config options.\nheading\n\nDefault: \"npm\"\nType: String\n\nThe string that starts all the debugging log output.\nhttps-proxy\n\nDefault: null\nType: null or URL\n\nA proxy to use for outgoing https requests. If the HTTPS_PROXY or\nhttps_proxy or HTTP_PROXY or http_proxy environment variables are set,\nproxy settings will be honored by the underlying make-fetch-happen\nlibrary.\nif-present\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf true, npm will not exit with an error code when run-script is invoked\nfor a script that isn't defined in the scripts section of package.json.\nThis option can be used when it's desirable to optionally run a script when\nit's present and fail if the script fails. This is useful, for example, when\nrunning scripts that may only apply for some builds in an otherwise generic\nCI setup.\nignore-scripts\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf true, npm does not run scripts specified in package.json files.\ninclude\n\nDefault:\nType: \"prod\", \"dev\", \"optional\", or \"peer\" (can be set multiple times)\n\nOption that allows for defining which types of dependencies to install.\nThis is the inverse of --omit=.\nDependency types specified in --include will not be omitted, regardless of\nthe order in which omit/include are specified on the command-line.\ninclude-staged\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nAllow installing \"staged\" published packages, as defined by [npm RFC PR\n92](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/92).\nThis is experimental, and not implemented by the npm public registry.\ninit-author-email\n\nDefault: \"\"\nType: String\n\nThe value npm init should use by default for the package author's email.\ninit-author-name\n\nDefault: \"\"\nType: String\n\nThe value npm init should use by default for the package author's name.\ninit-author-url\n\nDefault: \"\"\nType: \"\" or URL\n\nThe value npm init should use by default for the package author's\nhomepage.\ninit-license\n\nDefault: \"ISC\"\nType: String\n\nThe value npm init should use by default for the package license.\ninit-module\n\nDefault: \"~/.npm-init.js\"\nType: Path\n\nA module that will be loaded by the npm init command.

Values should be in PEM\nformat with newlines replaced by the string \"\\n\". For example:\nkey=\"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\nXXXX\\nXXXX\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\"\n\nIt is not the path to a key file (and there is no \"keyfile\" option).\nlegacy-bundling\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nCauses npm to install the package such that versions of npm prior to 1.4,\nsuch as the one included with node 0.8, can install the package. This\neliminates all automatic deduping. If used with global-style this option\nwill be preferred.\nlegacy-peer-deps\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nCauses npm to completely ignore peerDependencies when building a package\ntree, as in npm versions 3 through 6.\nIf a package cannot be installed because of overly strict peerDependencies\nthat collide, it provides a way to move forward resolving the situation.\nThis differs from --omit=peer, in that --omit=peer will avoid unpacking\npeerDependencies on disk, but will still design a tree such that\npeerDependencies could be unpacked in a correct place.\nUse of legacy-peer-deps is not recommended, as it will not enforce the\npeerDependencies contract that meta-dependencies may rely on.\nlink\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf true, then local installs will link if there is a suitable globally\ninstalled package.\nNote that this means that local installs can cause things to be installed\ninto the global space at the same time. The link is only done if one of the\ntwo conditions are met:\n\nThe package is not already installed globally, or\nthe globally installed version is identical to the version that is being\ninstalled locally.\n\nlocal-address\n\nDefault: null\nType: IP Address\n\nThe IP address of the local interface to use when making connections to the\nnpm registry. Must be IPv4 in versions of Node prior to 0.12.\nloglevel\n\nDefault: \"notice\"\nType: \"silent\", \"error\", \"warn\", \"notice\", \"http\", \"timing\", \"info\",\n\"verbose\", or \"silly\"\n\nWhat level of logs to report.

They are just not\nphysically installed on disk.\nIf a package type appears in both the --include and --omit lists, then\nit will be included.\nIf the resulting omit list includes 'dev', then the NODE_ENV environment\nvariable will be set to 'production' for all lifecycle scripts.\notp\n\nDefault: null\nType: null or String\n\nThis is a one-time password from a two-factor authenticator. It's needed\nwhen publishing or changing package permissions with npm access.\nIf not set, and a registry response fails with a challenge for a one-time\npassword, npm will prompt on the command line for one.\npackage\n\nDefault:\nType: String (can be set multiple times)\n\nThe package to install for npm exec\npackage-lock\n\nDefault: true\nType: Boolean\n\nIf set to false, then ignore package-lock.json files when installing. This\nwill also prevent writing package-lock.json if save is true.\nWhen package package-locks are disabled, automatic pruning of extraneous\nmodules will also be disabled. To remove extraneous modules with\npackage-locks disabled use npm prune.\npackage-lock-only\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf set to true, it will update only the package-lock.json, instead of\nchecking node_modules and downloading dependencies.\nparseable\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nOutput parseable results from commands that write to standard output. For\nnpm search, this will be tab-separated table format.\nprefer-offline\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf true, staleness checks for cached data will be bypassed, but missing data\nwill be requested from the server. To force full offline mode, use\n--offline.\nprefer-online\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf true, staleness checks for cached data will be forced, making the CLI\nlook for updates immediately even for fresh package data.\nprefix\n\nDefault: In global mode, the folder where the node executable is installed.\nIn local mode, the nearest parent folder containing either a package.json\nfile or a node_modules folder.\nType: Path\n\nThe location to install global items. If set on the command line, then it\nforces non-global commands to run in the specified folder.\npreid\n\nDefault: \"\"\nType: String\n\nThe \"prerelease identifier\" to use as a prefix for the \"prerelease\" part of\na semver. Like the rc in 1.2.0-rc.8.\nprogress\n\nDefault: true unless running in a known CI system\nType: Boolean\n\nWhen set to true, npm will display a progress bar during time intensive\noperations, if process.stderr is a TTY.\nSet to false to suppress the progress bar.\nproxy\n\nDefault: null\nType: null, false, or URL\n\nA proxy to use for outgoing http requests. If the HTTP_PROXY or\nhttp_proxy environment variables are set, proxy settings will be honored\nby the underlying request library.\nread-only\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nThis is used to mark a token as unable to publish when configuring limited\naccess tokens with the npm token create command.\nrebuild-bundle\n\nDefault: true\nType: Boolean\n\nRebuild bundled dependencies after installation.\nregistry\n\nDefault: \"https://registry.npmjs.org/\"\nType: URL\n\nThe base URL of the npm registry.\nsave\n\nDefault: true\nType: Boolean\n\nSave installed packages to a package.json file as dependencies.\nWhen used with the npm rm command, removes the dependency from\npackage.json.\nsave-bundle\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf a package would be saved at install time by the use of --save,\n--save-dev, or --save-optional, then also put it in the\nbundleDependencies list.\nIgnore if --save-peer is set, since peerDependencies cannot be bundled.\nsave-dev\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nSave installed packages to a package.json file as devDependencies.\nsave-exact\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nDependencies saved to package.json will be configured with an exact version\nrather than using npm's default semver range operator.\nsave-optional\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nSave installed packages to a package.json file as optionalDependencies.\nsave-peer\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nSave installed packages. to a package.json file as peerDependencies\nsave-prefix\n\nDefault: \"^\"\nType: String\n\nConfigure how versions of packages installed to a package.json file via\n--save or --save-dev get prefixed.\nFor example if a package has version 1.2.3, by default its version is set\nto ^1.2.3 which allows minor upgrades for that package, but after npm\nconfig set save-prefix='~' it would be set to ~1.2.3 which only allows\npatch upgrades.\nsave-prod\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nSave installed packages into dependencies specifically. This is useful if\na package already exists in devDependencies or optionalDependencies, but\nyou want to move it to be a non-optional production dependency.\nThis is the default behavior if --save is true, and neither --save-dev\nor --save-optional are true.\nscope\n\nDefault: the scope of the current project, if any, or \"\"\nType: String\n\nAssociate an operation with a scope for a scoped registry.\nUseful when logging in to a private registry for the first time:\nnpm login --scope=@mycorp --registry=https://registry.mycorp.com\n\nThis will cause @mycorp to be mapped to the registry for future\ninstallation of packages specified according to the pattern\n@mycorp/package.\nscript-shell\n\nDefault: '/bin/sh' on POSIX systems, 'cmd.exe' on Windows\nType: null or String\n\nThe shell to use for scripts run with the npm exec, npm run and npm\ninit  commands.\nsearchexclude\n\nDefault: \"\"\nType: String\n\nSpace-separated options that limit the results from search.\nsearchlimit\n\nDefault: 20\nType: Number\n\nNumber of items to limit search results to.

If --strict-peer-deps is set, then\nthis warning is treated as a failure.\nstrict-ssl\n\nDefault: true\nType: Boolean\n\nWhether or not to do SSL key validation when making requests to the registry\nvia https.\nSee also the ca config.\ntag\n\nDefault: \"latest\"\nType: String\n\nIf you ask npm to install a package and don't tell it a specific version,\nthen it will install the specified tag.\nAlso the tag that is added to the package@version specified by the npm tag\ncommand, if no explicit tag is given.\ntag-version-prefix\n\nDefault: \"v\"\nType: String\n\nIf set, alters the prefix used when tagging a new version when performing a\nversion increment using npm-version. To remove the prefix altogether, set\nit to the empty string: \"\".\nBecause other tools may rely on the convention that npm version tags look\nlike v1.0.0, only use this property if it is absolutely necessary. In\nparticular, use care when overriding this setting for public packages.\ntiming\n\nDefault: false\nType: Boolean\n\nIf true, writes an npm-debug log to _logs and timing information to\n_timing.json, both in your cache, even if the command completes\nsuccessfully. _timing.json is a newline delimited list of JSON objects.\nYou can quickly view it with this json command line:\nnpm exec -- json -g .\numask\n\nDefault: 0\nType: Octal numeric string in range 0000..0777 (0..511)\n\nThe \"umask\" value to use when setting the file creation mode on files and\nfolders.\nFolders and executables are given a mode which is 0o777 masked against\nthis value. Other files are given a mode which is 0o666 masked against\nthis value.\nNote that the underlying system will also apply its own umask value to\nfiles and folders that are created, and npm does not circumvent this, but\nrather adds the --umask config to it.\nThus, the effective default umask value on most POSIX systems is 0o22,\nmeaning that folders and executables are created with a mode of 0o755 and\nother files are created with a mode of 0o644.\nunicode\n\nDefault: false on windows, true on mac/unix systems with a unicode locale,\nas defined by the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, or LANG environment variables.\nType: Boolean\n\nWhen set to true, npm uses unicode characters in the tree output.

If you install npm, you should be able to\nthen do man npm-thing to get the documentation on a particular\ntopic, or npm help thing to see the same information.\nWhat is a Package\nA package is:\n\na) a folder containing a program described by a package.json file\nb) a gzipped tarball containing (a)\nc) a url that resolves to (b)\nd) a @ that is published on the registry with (c)\ne) a @ that points to (d)\nf) a  that has a \"latest\" tag satisfying (e)\ng) a git url that, when cloned, results in (a).\n\nEven if you never publish your package, you can still get a lot of\nbenefits of using npm if you just want to write a node program (a), and\nperhaps if you also want to be able to easily install it elsewhere\nafter packing it up into a tarball (b).\nGit urls can be of the form:\ngit://github.com/user/project.git#commit-ish\ngit+ssh://user@hostname:project.git#commit-ish\ngit+http://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish\ngit+https://user@hostname/project/blah.git#commit-ish\n\nThe commit-ish can be any tag, sha, or branch which can be supplied as\nan argument to git checkout.  The default is whatever the repository uses\nas its default branch.\nThe package.json File\nYou need to have a package.json file in the root of your project to do\nmuch of anything with npm.  That is basically the whole interface.\nSee package.json for details about what\ngoes in that file.  At the very least, you need:\n\nname: This should be a string that identifies your project.  Please do\nnot use the name to specify that it runs on node, or is in JavaScript.\nYou can use the \"engines\" field to explicitly state the versions of node\n(or whatever else) that your program requires, and it's pretty well\nassumed that it's JavaScript.\nIt does not necessarily need to match your github repository name.\nSo, node-foo and bar-js are bad names.  foo or bar are better.\n\nversion: A semver-compatible version.\n\nengines: Specify the versions of node (or whatever else) that your\nprogram runs on.  The node API changes a lot, and there may be bugs or\nnew functionality that you depend on.  Be explicit.\n\nauthor: Take some credit.\n\nscripts: If you have a special compilation or installation script, then\nyou should put it in the scripts object.  You should definitely have at\nleast a basic smoke-test command as the \"scripts.test\" field.  See\nscripts.\n\nmain: If you have a single module that serves as the entry point to your\nprogram (like what the \"foo\" package gives you at require(\"foo\")), then\nyou need to specify that in the \"main\" field.\n\ndirectories: This is an object mapping names to folders.  The best ones\nto include are \"lib\" and \"doc\", but if you use \"man\" to specify a folder\nfull of man pages, they'll get installed just like these ones.\n\n\nYou can use npm init in the root of your package in order to get you\nstarted with a pretty basic package.json file.  See npm\ninit for more info.\nKeeping files out of your Package\nUse a .npmignore file to keep stuff out of your package.  If there's no\n.npmignore file, but there is a .gitignore file, then npm will ignore\nthe stuff matched by the .gitignore file.  If you want to include\nsomething that is excluded by your .gitignore file, you can create an\nempty .npmignore file to override it. Like git, npm looks for\n.npmignore and .gitignore files in all subdirectories of your package,\nnot only the root directory.\n.npmignore files follow the same pattern\nrules\nas .gitignore files:\n\nBlank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.\nStandard glob patterns work.\nYou can end patterns with a forward slash / to specify a directory.\nYou can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point !.\n\nBy default, the following paths and files are ignored, so there's no\nneed to add them to .npmignore explicitly:\n\n.*.swp\n._*\n.DS_Store\n.git\n.hg\n.npmrc\n.lock-wscript\n.svn\n.wafpickle-*\nconfig.gypi\nCVS\nnpm-debug.log\n\nAdditionally, everything in node_modules is ignored, except for\nbundled dependencies. npm automatically handles this for you, so don't\nbother adding node_modules to .npmignore.\nThe following paths and files are never ignored, so adding them to\n.npmignore is pointless:\n\npackage.json\nREADME (and its variants)\nCHANGELOG (and its variants)\nLICENSE / LICENCE\n\nIf, given the structure of your project, you find .npmignore to be a\nmaintenance headache, you might instead try populating the files\nproperty of package.json, which is an array of file or directory names\nthat should be included in your package. Sometimes manually picking\nwhich items to allow is easier to manage than building a block list.\nTesting whether your .npmignore or files config works\nIf you want to double check that your package will include only the files\nyou intend it to when published, you can run the npm pack command locally\nwhich will generate a tarball in the working directory, the same way it\ndoes for publishing.\nLink Packages\nnpm link is designed to install a development package and see the\nchanges in real time without having to keep re-installing it.  (You do\nneed to either re-link or npm rebuild -g to update compiled packages,\nof course.)\nMore info at npm link.\nBefore Publishing: Make Sure Your Package Installs and Works\nThis is important.\nIf you can not install it locally, you'll have\nproblems trying to publish it.  Or, worse yet, you'll be able to\npublish it, but you'll be publishing a broken or pointless package.\nSo don't do that.\nIn the root of your package, do this:\nnpm install . -g\n\nThat'll show you that it's working.  If you'd rather just create a symlink\npackage that points to your working directory, then do this:\nnpm link\n\nUse npm ls -g to see if it's there.\nTo test a local install, go into some other folder, and then do:\ncd ../some-other-folder\nnpm install ../my-package\n\nto install it locally into the node_modules folder in that other place.\nThen go into the node-repl, and try using require(\"my-thing\") to\nbring in your module's main module.\nCreate a User Account\nCreate a user with the adduser command.  It works like this:\nnpm adduser\n\nand then follow the prompts.\nThis is documented better in npm adduser.\nPublish your Package\nThis part's easy.  In the root of your folder, do this:\nnpm publish\n\nYou can give publish a url to a tarball, or a filename of a tarball,\nor a path to a folder.\nNote that pretty much everything in that folder will be exposed\nby default.  So, if you have secret stuff in there, use a\n.npmignore file to list out the globs to ignore, or publish\nfrom a fresh checkout.\nBrag about it\nSend emails, write blogs, blab in IRC.\nTell the world how easy it is to install your program!\nSee also\n\nnpm\nnpm init\npackage.json\nnpm scripts\nnpm publish\nnpm adduser\nnpm registry\n\n"},"using-npm/orgs.html":{"url":"using-npm/orgs.html","title":"Orgs","summary":"Working with Teams & Orgs","keywords":"","body":"Description\nThere are three levels of org users:\n\nSuper admin, controls billing & adding people to the org.\nTeam admin, manages team membership & package access.\nDeveloper, works on packages they are given access to.  \n\nThe super admin is the only person who can add users to the org because it impacts the monthly bill.

Some package names also have a scope. A scope\nfollows the usual rules for package names (URL-safe characters, no leading dots\nor underscores). When used in package names, scopes are preceded by an @ symbol\nand followed by a slash, e.g.\n@somescope/somepackagename\n\nScopes are a way of grouping related packages together, and also affect a few\nthings about the way npm treats the package.\nEach npm user/organization has their own scope, and only you can add packages\nin your scope. This means you don't have to worry about someone taking your\npackage name ahead of you. Thus it is also a good way to signal official packages\nfor organizations.\nScoped packages can be published and installed as of npm@2 and are supported\nby the primary npm registry. Unscoped packages can depend on scoped packages and\nvice versa. The npm client is backwards-compatible with unscoped registries,\nso it can be used to work with scoped and unscoped registries at the same time.\nInstalling scoped packages\nScoped packages are installed to a sub-folder of the regular installation\nfolder, e.g. if your other packages are installed in node_modules/packagename,\nscoped modules will be installed in node_modules/@myorg/packagename. The scope\nfolder (@myorg) is simply the name of the scope preceded by an @ symbol, and can\ncontain any number of scoped packages.\nA scoped package is installed by referencing it by name, preceded by an\n@ symbol, in npm install:\nnpm install @myorg/mypackage\n\nOr in package.json:\n\"dependencies\": {\n  \"@myorg/mypackage\": \"^1.3.0\"\n}\n\nNote that if the @ symbol is omitted, in either case, npm will instead attempt to\ninstall from GitHub; see npm install.\nRequiring scoped packages\nBecause scoped packages are installed into a scope folder, you have to\ninclude the name of the scope when requiring them in your code, e.g.\nrequire('@myorg/mypackage')\n\nThere is nothing special about the way Node treats scope folders. This\nsimply requires the mypackage module in the folder named @myorg.\nPublishing scoped packages\nScoped packages can be published from the CLI as of npm@2 and can be\npublished to any registry that supports them, including the primary npm\nregistry.\n(As of 2015-04-19, and with npm 2.0 or better, the primary npm registry\ndoes support scoped packages.)\nIf you wish, you may associate a scope with a registry; see below.\nPublishing public scoped packages to the primary npm registry\nTo publish a public scoped package, you must specify --access public with\nthe initial publication. This will publish the package and set access\nto public as if you had run npm access public after publishing.\nPublishing private scoped packages to the npm registry\nTo publish a private scoped package to the npm registry, you must have\nan npm Private Modules\naccount.\nYou can then publish the module with npm publish or npm publish\n--access restricted, and it will be present in the npm registry, with\nrestricted access. You can then change the access permissions, if\ndesired, with npm access or on the npmjs.com website.\nAssociating a scope with a registry\nScopes can be associated with a separate registry. This allows you to\nseamlessly use a mix of packages from the primary npm registry and one or more\nprivate registries, such as npm Enterprise.\nYou can associate a scope with a registry at login, e.g.\nnpm login --registry=http://reg.example.com --scope=@myco\n\nScopes have a many-to-one relationship with registries: one registry can\nhost multiple scopes, but a scope only ever points to one registry.\nYou can also associate a scope with a registry using npm config:\nnpm config set @myco:registry http://reg.example.com\n\nOnce a scope is associated with a registry, any npm install for a package\nwith that scope will request packages from that registry instead. Any\nnpm publish for a package name that contains the scope will be published to\nthat registry instead.\nSee also\n\nnpm install\nnpm publish\nnpm access\nnpm registry\n\n"},"using-npm/scripts.html":{"url":"using-npm/scripts.html","title":"Scripts","summary":"How npm handles the \"scripts\" field","keywords":"","body":"Description\nThe \"scripts\" property of your package.json file supports a number\nof built-in scripts and their preset life cycle events as well as\narbitrary scripts. These all can be executed by running\nnpm run-script  or npm run  for short. Pre and post\ncommands with matching names will be run for those as well (e.g. premyscript,\nmyscript, postmyscript). Scripts from dependencies can be run with\nnpm explore  -- npm run .\nPre & Post Scripts\nTo create \"pre\" or \"post\" scripts for any scripts defined in the\n\"scripts\" section of the package.json, simply create another script\nwith a matching name and add \"pre\" or \"post\" to the beginning of them.\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"precompress\": \"{{ executes BEFORE the `compress` script }}\",\n    \"compress\": \"{{ run command to compress files }}\",\n    \"postcompress\": \"{{ executes AFTER `compress` script }}\"\n  }\n}\n\nIn this example npm run compress would execute these scripts as\ndescribed.\nLife Cycle Scripts\nThere are some special life cycle scripts that happen only in certain\nsituations.

It has also turned out to be, in practice, very confusing.  As of npm@4.0.0, a new event has been introduced, prepare, that preserves this existing behavior. A new event, prepublishOnly has been added as a transitional strategy to allow users to avoid the confusing behavior of existing npm versions and only run on npm publish (for instance, running the tests one last time to ensure they're in good shape).\nSee https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/10074 for a much lengthier justification, with further reading, for this change.\nUse Cases\nIf you need to perform operations on your package before it is used, in a way that is not dependent on the operating system or architecture of the target system, use a prepublish script. This includes tasks such as:\n\nCompiling CoffeeScript source code into JavaScript.\nCreating minified versions of JavaScript source code.\nFetching remote resources that your package will use.\n\nThe advantage of doing these things at prepublish time is that they can be done once, in a single place, thus reducing complexity and variability. Additionally, this means that:\n\nYou can depend on coffee-script as a devDependency, and thus\nyour users don't need to have it installed.\nYou don't need to include minifiers in your package, reducing\nthe size for your users.\nYou don't need to rely on your users having curl or wget or\nother system tools on the target machines.\n\nLife Cycle Operation Order\nnpm cache add\n\nprepare\n\nnpm ci\n\npreinstall\ninstall\npostinstall\nprepublish\npreprepare\nprepare\npostprepare\nThese all run after the actual installation of modules into\nnode_modules, in order, with no internal actions happening in between\n\n\nnpm diff\n\nprepare\n\nnpm install\nThese also run when you run npm install -g \n\npreinstall\ninstall\npostinstall\nprepublish\npreprepare\nprepare\npostprepare\n\nIf there is a binding.gyp file in the root of your package and you\nhaven't defined your own install or preinstall scripts, npm will\ndefault the install command to compile using node-gyp via node-gyp\nrebuild\nThese are run from the scripts of \nnpm pack\n\nprepack\nprepare\npostpack\n\nnpm publish\n\nprepublishOnly\nprepack\nprepare\npostpack\npublish\npostpublish\n\nprepare will not run during --dry-run\nnpm rebuild\n\npreinstall\ninstall\npostinstall\nprepare\n\nprepare is only run if the current directory is a symlink (e.g. with\nlinked packages)\nnpm restart\nIf there is a restart script defined, these events are run, otherwise\nstop and start are both run if present, including their pre and\npost iterations)\n\nprerestart\nrestart\npostrestart\n\nnpm run \n\npre\n\npost\n\nnpm start\n\nprestart\nstart\npoststart\n\nIf there is a server.js file in the root of your package, then npm\nwill default the start command to node server.js.  prestart and\npoststart will still run in this case.\nnpm stop\n\nprestop\nstop\npoststop\n\nnpm test\n\npretest\ntest\nposttest\n\nUser\nWhen npm is run as root, scripts are always run with the effective uid\nand gid of the working directory owner.\nEnvironment\nPackage scripts run in an environment where many pieces of information\nare made available regarding the setup of npm and the current state of\nthe process.\npath\nIf you depend on modules that define executable scripts, like test\nsuites, then those executables will be added to the PATH for\nexecuting the scripts.  So, if your package.json has this:\n{\n  \"name\" : \"foo\",\n  \"dependencies\" : {\n    \"bar\" : \"0.1.x\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"start\" : \"bar ./test\"\n  }\n}\n\nthen you could run npm start to execute the bar script, which is\nexported into the node_modules/.bin directory on npm install.\npackage.json vars\nThe package.json fields are tacked onto the npm_package_ prefix. So,\nfor instance, if you had {\"name\":\"foo\", \"version\":\"1.2.5\"} in your\npackage.json file, then your package scripts would have the\nnpm_package_name environment variable set to \"foo\", and the\nnpm_package_version set to \"1.2.5\".  You can access these variables\nin your code with process.env.npm_package_name and\nprocess.env.npm_package_version, and so on for other fields.\nconfiguration\nConfiguration parameters are put in the environment with the\nnpm_config_ prefix. For instance, you can view the effective root\nconfig by checking the npm_config_root environment variable.\nSpecial: package.json \"config\" object\nThe package.json \"config\" keys are overwritten in the environment if\nthere is a config param of [@]:.  For example,\nif the package.json has this:\n{\n  \"name\" : \"foo\",\n  \"config\" : {\n    \"port\" : \"8080\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\" : {\n    \"start\" : \"node server.js\"\n  }\n}\n\nand the server.js is this:\nhttp.createServer(...).listen(process.env.npm_package_config_port)\n\nthen the user could change the behavior by doing:\n  npm config set foo:port 80\n\ncurrent lifecycle event\nLastly, the npm_lifecycle_event environment variable is set to\nwhichever stage of the cycle is being executed. So, you could have a\nsingle script used for different parts of the process which switches\nbased on what's currently happening.\nObjects are flattened following this format, so if you had\n{\"scripts\":{\"install\":\"foo.js\"}} in your package.json, then you'd\nsee this in the script:\nprocess.env.npm_package_scripts_install === \"foo.js\"\n\nExamples\nFor example, if your package.json contains this:\n{\n  \"scripts\" : {\n    \"install\" : \"scripts/install.js\",\n    \"postinstall\" : \"scripts/postinstall.js\",\n    \"uninstall\" : \"scripts/uninstall.js\"\n  }\n}\n\nthen scripts/install.js will be called for the install\nand post-install stages of the lifecycle, and scripts/uninstall.js\nwill be called when the package is uninstalled.  Since\nscripts/install.js is running for two different phases, it would\nbe wise in this case to look at the npm_lifecycle_event environment\nvariable.\nIf you want to run a make command, you can do so.  This works just\nfine:\n{\n  \"scripts\" : {\n    \"preinstall\" : \"./configure\",\n    \"install\" : \"make && make install\",\n    \"test\" : \"make test\"\n  }\n}\n\nExiting\nScripts are run by passing the line as a script argument to sh.\nIf the script exits with a code other than 0, then this will abort the\nprocess.\nNote that these script files don't have to be nodejs or even\njavascript programs. They just have to be some kind of executable\nfile.\nHook Scripts\nIf you want to run a specific script at a specific lifecycle event for\nALL packages, then you can use a hook script.\nPlace an executable file at node_modules/.hooks/{eventname}, and\nit'll get run for all packages when they are going through that point\nin the package lifecycle for any packages installed in that root.\nHook scripts are run exactly the same way as package.json scripts.\nThat is, they are in a separate child process, with the env described\nabove.\nBest Practices\n\nDon't exit with a non-zero error code unless you really mean it.\nExcept for uninstall scripts, this will cause the npm action to\nfail, and potentially be rolled back.  If the failure is minor or\nonly will prevent some optional features, then it's better to just\nprint a warning and exit successfully.\nTry not to use scripts to do what npm can do for you.  Read through\npackage.json to see all the things that you can specify and enable\nby simply describing your package appropriately.  In general, this\nwill lead to a more robust and consistent state.\nInspect the env to determine where to put things.  For instance, if\nthe npm_config_binroot environment variable is set to /home/user/bin, then\ndon't try to install executables into /usr/local/bin.  The user\nprobably set it up that way for a reason.\nDon't prefix your script commands with \"sudo\".  If root permissions\nare required for some reason, then it'll fail with that error, and\nthe user will sudo the npm command in question.\nDon't use install. Use a .gyp file for compilation, and prepublish\nfor anything else. You should almost never have to explicitly set a\npreinstall or install script. If you are doing this, please consider if\nthere is another option. The only valid use of install or preinstall\nscripts is for compilation which must be done on the target architecture.\n\nSee Also\n\nnpm run-script\npackage.json\nnpm developers\nnpm install\n\n"},"using-npm/workspaces.html":{"url":"using-npm/workspaces.html","title":"Workspaces","summary":"Working with workspaces","keywords":"","body":"Description\nWorkspaces is a generic term that refers to the set of features in the\nnpm cli that provides support to managing multiple packages from your local\nfiles system from within a singular top-level, root package.\nThis set of features makes up for a much more streamlined workflow handling\nlinked packages from the local file system. Automating the linking process\nas part of npm install and avoiding manually having to use npm link in\norder to add references to packages that should be symlinked into the current\nnode_modules folder.\nWe also refer to these packages being auto-symlinked during npm install as a\nsingle workspace, meaning it's a nested package within the current local\nfile system that is explicitly defined in the package.json\nworkspaces configuration.\nInstalling workspaces\nWorkspaces are usually defined via the workspaces property of the\npackage.json file, e.g:\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-workspaces-powered-project\",\n  \"workspaces\": [\n    \"workspace-a\"\n  ]\n}\n\nGiven the above package.json example living at a current working\ndirectory . that contains a folder named workspace-a that disposes\nof a package.json inside it, defining a nodejs package, e.g:\n.\n+-- package.json\n`-- workspace-a\n   `-- package.json\nThe expected result once running npm install in this current working\ndirectory . is that the folder workspace-a will get symlinked to the\nnode_modules folder of the current working dir.\nBelow is a post npm install example, given that same previous example\nstructure of files and folders:\n.\n+-- node_modules\n|  `-- workspace-a -> ../workspace-a\n+-- package-lock.json\n+-- package.json\n`-- workspace-a\n   `-- package.json\nUsing workspaces\nGiven the specifities of how Node.js handles module resolution it's possible to consume any defined workspace\nby it's declared package.json name. Continuing from the example defined\nabove, let's also create a Node.js script that will require the workspace-a\nexample module, e.g:\n// ./workspace-a/index.js\nmodule.exports = 'a'\n\n// ./lib/index.js\nconst moduleA = require('workspace-a')\nconsole.log(moduleA) // -> a\nWhen running it with:\nnode lib/index.js\nThis demonstrates how the nature of node_modules resolution allows for\nworkspaces to enable a portable workflow for requiring each workspace\nin such a way that is also easy to publish these\nnested workspaces to be consumed elsewhere.\nRunning commands in the context of workspaces\nYou can use the workspace configuration option to run commands in the context\nof a configured workspace.\nFollowing is a quick example on how to use the npm run command in the context\nof nested workspaces. For a project containing multiple workspaces, e.g:\n.\n+-- package.json\n`-- packages\n   +-- a\n   |   `-- package.json\n   `-- b\n       `-- package.json\nBy running a command using the workspace option, it's possible to run the\ngiven command in the context of that specific workspace. e.g:\nnpm run test --workspace=a\nThis will run the test script defined within the\n./packages/a/package.json file.\nPlease note that you can also specify this argument multiple times in the\ncommand-line in order to target multiple workspaces, e.g:\nnpm run test --workspace=a --workspace=b\nIt's also possible to use the workspaces (plural) configuration option to\nenable the same behavior but running that command in the context of all\nconfigured workspaces. e.g:\nnpm run test --workspaces\nWill run the test script in both ./packages/a and ./packages/b.\nSee also\n\nnpm install\nnpm publish\nnpm run-script\n\n"},"./":{"url":"./","title":"package.json","summary":"Specifics of npm's package.json handling","keywords":"","body":"Description\nThis document is all you need to know about what's required in your\npackage.json file.

These are helpful for people who encounter\nissues with your package.\nIt should look like this:\n{\n  \"url\" : \"https://github.com/owner/project/issues\",\n  \"email\" : \"project@hostname.com\"\n}\n\nYou can specify either one or both values. If you want to provide only a\nurl, you can specify the value for \"bugs\" as a simple string instead of an\nobject.\nIf a url is provided, it will be used by the npm bugs command.\nlicense\nYou should specify a license for your package so that people know how they\nare permitted to use it, and any restrictions you're placing on it.\nIf you're using a common license such as BSD-2-Clause or MIT, add a current\nSPDX license identifier for the license you're using, like this:\n{\n  \"license\" : \"BSD-3-Clause\"\n}\n\nYou can check the full list of SPDX license\nIDs.  Ideally you should pick one that is\nOSI approved.\nIf your package is licensed under multiple common licenses, use an SPDX\nlicense expression syntax version 2.0\nstring, like this:\n{\n  \"license\" : \"(ISC OR GPL-3.0)\"\n}\n\nIf you are using a license that hasn't been assigned an SPDX identifier, or if\nyou are using a custom license, use a string value like this one:\n{\n  \"license\" : \"SEE LICENSE IN \"\n}\n\nThen include a file named  at the top level of the package.\nSome old packages used license objects or a \"licenses\" property containing\nan array of license objects:\n// Not valid metadata\n{\n  \"license\" : {\n    \"type\" : \"ISC\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Not valid metadata\n{\n  \"licenses\" : [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"MIT\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"Apache-2.0\",\n      \"url\": \"https://opensource.org/licenses/apache2.0.php\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThose styles are now deprecated. Instead, use SPDX expressions, like this:\n{\n  \"license\": \"ISC\"\n}\n\n{\n  \"license\": \"(MIT OR Apache-2.0)\"\n}\n\nFinally, if you do not wish to grant others the right to use a private or\nunpublished package under any terms:\n{\n  \"license\": \"UNLICENSED\"\n}\n\nConsider also setting \"private\": true to prevent accidental publication.\npeople fields: author, contributors\nThe \"author\" is one person.  \"contributors\" is an array of people.  A\n\"person\" is an object with a \"name\" field and optionally \"url\" and \"email\",\nlike this:\n{\n  \"name\" : \"Barney Rubble\",\n  \"email\" : \"b@rubble.com\",\n  \"url\" : \"http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/\"\n}\n\nOr you can shorten that all into a single string, and npm will parse it for\nyou:\n{\n  \"author\": \"Barney Rubble  (http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/)\"\n}\n\nBoth email and url are optional either way.\nnpm also sets a top-level \"maintainers\" field with your npm user info.\nfunding\nYou can specify an object containing an URL that provides up-to-date\ninformation about ways to help fund development of your package, or a\nstring URL, or an array of these:\n{\n  \"funding\": {\n    \"type\" : \"individual\",\n    \"url\" : \"http://example.com/donate\"\n  },\n\n  \"funding\": {\n    \"type\" : \"patreon\",\n    \"url\" : \"https://www.patreon.com/my-account\"\n  },\n\n  \"funding\": \"http://example.com/donate\",\n\n  \"funding\": [\n    {\n      \"type\" : \"individual\",\n      \"url\" : \"http://example.com/donate\"\n    },\n    \"http://example.com/donateAlso\",\n    {\n      \"type\" : \"patreon\",\n      \"url\" : \"https://www.patreon.com/my-account\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nUsers can use the npm fund subcommand to list the funding URLs of all\ndependencies of their project, direct and indirect. A shortcut to visit\neach funding url is also available when providing the project name such as:\nnpm fund  (when there are multiple URLs, the first one will\nbe visited)\nfiles\nThe optional files field is an array of file patterns that describes the\nentries to be included when your package is installed as a dependency. File\npatterns follow a similar syntax to .gitignore, but reversed: including a\nfile, directory, or glob pattern (*, **/*, and such) will make it so\nthat file is included in the tarball when it's packed. Omitting the field\nwill make it default to [\"*\"], which means it will include all files.\nSome special files and directories are also included or excluded regardless\nof whether they exist in the files array (see below).\nYou can also provide a .npmignore file in the root of your package or in\nsubdirectories, which will keep files from being included. At the root of\nyour package it will not override the \"files\" field, but in subdirectories\nit will. The .npmignore file works just like a .gitignore. If there is\na .gitignore file, and .npmignore is missing, .gitignore's contents\nwill be used instead.\nFiles included with the \"package.json#files\" field cannot be excluded\nthrough .npmignore or .gitignore.\nCertain files are always included, regardless of settings:\n\npackage.json\nREADME\nCHANGES / CHANGELOG / HISTORY\nLICENSE / LICENCE\nNOTICE\nThe file in the \"main\" field\n\nREADME, CHANGES, LICENSE & NOTICE can have any case and extension.\nConversely, some files are always ignored:\n\n.git\nCVS\n.svn\n.hg\n.lock-wscript\n.wafpickle-N\n.*.swp\n.DS_Store\n._*\nnpm-debug.log\n.npmrc\nnode_modules\nconfig.gypi\n*.orig\npackage-lock.json (use\nnpm-shrinkwrap.json if you wish\nit to be published)\n\nmain\nThe main field is a module ID that is the primary entry point to your\nprogram.  That is, if your package is named foo, and a user installs it,\nand then does require(\"foo\"), then your main module's exports object will\nbe returned.\nThis should be a module relative to the root of your package folder.\nFor most modules, it makes the most sense to have a main script and often\nnot much else.\nIf main is not set it defaults to index.js in the packages root folder.\nbrowser\nIf your module is meant to be used client-side the browser field should be\nused instead of the main field. This is helpful to hint users that it might\nrely on primitives that aren't available in Node.js modules. (e.g.\nwindow)\nbin\nA lot of packages have one or more executable files that they'd like to\ninstall into the PATH. npm makes this pretty easy (in fact, it uses this\nfeature to install the \"npm\" executable.)\nTo use this, supply a bin field in your package.json which is a map of\ncommand name to local file name. On install, npm will symlink that file\ninto prefix/bin for global installs, or ./node_modules/.bin/ for local\ninstalls.\nFor example, myapp could have this:\n{\n  \"bin\": {\n    \"myapp\": \"./cli.js\"\n  }\n}\n\nSo, when you install myapp, it'll create a symlink from the cli.js script\nto /usr/local/bin/myapp.\nIf you have a single executable, and its name should be the name of the\npackage, then you can just supply it as a string.  For example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-program\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.5\",\n  \"bin\": \"./path/to/program\"\n}\n\nwould be the same as this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-program\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.5\",\n  \"bin\": {\n    \"my-program\": \"./path/to/program\"\n  }\n}\n\nPlease make sure that your file(s) referenced in bin starts with\n#!/usr/bin/env node, otherwise the scripts are started without the node\nexecutable!\nNote that you can also set the executable files using directories.bin.\nman\nSpecify either a single file or an array of filenames to put in place for\nthe man program to find.\nIf only a single file is provided, then it's installed such that it is the\nresult from man , regardless of its actual filename.  For\nexample:\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"description\": \"A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos\",\n  \"main\": \"foo.js\",\n  \"man\": \"./man/doc.1\"\n}\n\nwould link the ./man/doc.1 file in such that it is the target for man\nfoo\nIf the filename doesn't start with the package name, then it's prefixed.\nSo, this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"description\": \"A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos\",\n  \"main\": \"foo.js\",\n  \"man\": [\n    \"./man/foo.1\",\n    \"./man/bar.1\"\n  ]\n}\n\nwill create files to do man foo and man foo-bar.\nMan files must end with a number, and optionally a .gz suffix if they are\ncompressed.  The number dictates which man section the file is installed\ninto.\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"description\": \"A packaged foo fooer for fooing foos\",\n  \"main\": \"foo.js\",\n  \"man\": [\n    \"./man/foo.1\",\n    \"./man/foo.2\"\n  ]\n}\n\nwill create entries for man foo and man 2 foo\ndirectories\nThe CommonJS Packages spec\ndetails a few ways that you can indicate the structure of your package\nusing a directories object. If you look at npm's\npackage.json, you'll see that it\nhas directories for doc, lib, and man.\nIn the future, this information may be used in other creative ways.\ndirectories.bin\nIf you specify a bin directory in directories.bin, all the files in\nthat folder will be added.\nBecause of the way the bin directive works, specifying both a bin path\nand setting directories.bin is an error. If you want to specify\nindividual files, use bin, and for all the files in an existing bin\ndirectory, use directories.bin.\ndirectories.man\nA folder that is full of man pages.  Sugar to generate a \"man\" array by\nwalking the folder.\nrepository\nSpecify the place where your code lives. This is helpful for people who\nwant to contribute.  If the git repo is on GitHub, then the npm docs\ncommand will be able to find you.\nDo it like this:\n{\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/npm/cli.git\"\n  }\n}\n\nThe URL should be a publicly available (perhaps read-only) url that can be\nhanded directly to a VCS program without any modification.  It should not\nbe a url to an html project page that you put in your browser.  It's for\ncomputers.\nFor GitHub, GitHub gist, Bitbucket, or GitLab repositories you can use the\nsame shortcut syntax you use for npm install:\n{\n  \"repository\": \"npm/npm\",\n\n  \"repository\": \"github:user/repo\",\n\n  \"repository\": \"gist:11081aaa281\",\n\n  \"repository\": \"bitbucket:user/repo\",\n\n  \"repository\": \"gitlab:user/repo\"\n}\n\nIf the package.json for your package is not in the root directory (for\nexample if it is part of a monorepo), you can specify the directory in\nwhich it lives:\n{\n  \"repository\": {\n    \"type\": \"git\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/facebook/react.git\",\n    \"directory\": \"packages/react-dom\"\n  }\n}\n\nscripts\nThe \"scripts\" property is a dictionary containing script commands that are\nrun at various times in the lifecycle of your package.  The key is the\nlifecycle event, and the value is the command to run at that point.\nSee scripts to find out more about writing package\nscripts.\nconfig\nA \"config\" object can be used to set configuration parameters used in\npackage scripts that persist across upgrades.  For instance, if a package\nhad the following:\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"config\": {\n    \"port\": \"8080\"\n  }\n}\n\nand then had a \"start\" command that then referenced the\nnpm_package_config_port environment variable, then the user could\noverride that by doing npm config set foo:port 8001.\nSee config and scripts for\nmore on package configs.\ndependencies\nDependencies are specified in a simple object that maps a package name to a\nversion range. The version range is a string which has one or more\nspace-separated descriptors.  Dependencies can also be identified with a\ntarball or git URL.\nPlease do not put test harnesses or transpilers or other \"development\"\ntime tools in your dependencies object.  See devDependencies, below.\nSee semver for more details about specifying version ranges.\n\nversion Must match version exactly\n>version Must be greater than version\n>=version etc\n\n\n~version \"Approximately equivalent to version\"  See\nsemver\n^version \"Compatible with version\"  See semver\n1.2.x 1.2.0, 1.2.1, etc., but not 1.3.0\nhttp://...

See 'Git URLs as Dependencies' below\nuser/repo See 'GitHub URLs' below\ntag A specific version tagged and published as tag  See npm\ndist-tag\npath/path/path See Local Paths below\n\nFor example, these are all valid:\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"foo\": \"1.0.0 - 2.9999.9999\",\n    \"bar\": \">=1.0.2 1.0.2 =2.3.1 =2.5.2 \nURLs as Dependencies\nYou may specify a tarball URL in place of a version range.\nThis tarball will be downloaded and installed locally to your package at\ninstall time.\nGit URLs as Dependencies\nGit urls are of the form:\n://[[:]@][:][:][/][# | #semver:]\n\n is one of git, git+ssh, git+http, git+https, or\ngit+file.\nIf # is provided, it will be used to clone exactly that\ncommit. If the commit-ish has the format #semver:,  can\nbe any valid semver range or exact version, and npm will look for any tags\nor refs matching that range in the remote repository, much as it would for\na registry dependency. If neither # or #semver: is\nspecified, then master is used.\nExamples:\ngit+ssh://git@github.com:npm/cli.git#v1.0.27\ngit+ssh://git@github.com:npm/cli#semver:^5.0\ngit+https://isaacs@github.com/npm/cli.git\ngit://github.com/npm/cli.git#v1.0.27\n\nGitHub URLs\nAs of version 1.1.65, you can refer to GitHub urls as just \"foo\":\n\"user/foo-project\".  Just as with git URLs, a commit-ish suffix can be\nincluded.  For example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"foo\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.0\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"express\": \"expressjs/express\",\n    \"mocha\": \"mochajs/mocha#4727d357ea\",\n    \"module\": \"user/repo#feature\\/branch\"\n  }\n}\n\nLocal Paths\nAs of version 2.0.0 you can provide a path to a local directory that\ncontains a package. Local paths can be saved using npm install -S or npm\ninstall --save, using any of these forms:\n../foo/bar\n~/foo/bar\n./foo/bar\n/foo/bar\n\nin which case they will be normalized to a relative path and added to your\npackage.json. For example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"baz\",\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"bar\": \"file:../foo/bar\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis feature is helpful for local offline development and creating tests\nthat require npm installing where you don't want to hit an external server,\nbut should not be used when publishing packages to the public registry.\ndevDependencies\nIf someone is planning on downloading and using your module in their\nprogram, then they probably don't want or need to download and build the\nexternal test or documentation framework that you use.\nIn this case, it's best to map these additional items in a\ndevDependencies object.\nThese things will be installed when doing npm link or npm install from\nthe root of a package, and can be managed like any other npm configuration\nparam.  See config for more on the topic.\nFor build steps that are not platform-specific, such as compiling\nCoffeeScript or other languages to JavaScript, use the prepare script to\ndo this, and make the required package a devDependency.\nFor example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"ethopia-waza\",\n  \"description\": \"a delightfully fruity coffee varietal\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"coffee-script\": \"~1.6.3\"\n  },\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"prepare\": \"coffee -o lib/ -c src/waza.coffee\"\n  },\n  \"main\": \"lib/waza.js\"\n}\n\nThe prepare script will be run before publishing, so that users can\nconsume the functionality without requiring them to compile it themselves.\nIn dev mode (ie, locally running npm install), it'll run this script as\nwell, so that you can test it easily.\npeerDependencies\nIn some cases, you want to express the compatibility of your package with a\nhost tool or library, while not necessarily doing a require of this host.\nThis is usually referred to as a plugin. Notably, your module may be\nexposing a specific interface, expected and specified by the host\ndocumentation.\nFor example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"tea-latte\",\n  \"version\": \"1.3.5\",\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"tea\": \"2.x\"\n  }\n}\n\nThis ensures your package tea-latte can be installed along with the\nsecond major version of the host package tea only. npm install\ntea-latte could possibly yield the following dependency graph:\n├── tea-latte@1.3.5\n└── tea@2.2.0\n\nIn npm versions 3 through 6, peerDependencies were not automatically\ninstalled, and would raise a warning if an invalid version of the peer\ndependency was found in the tree.  As of npm v7, peerDependencies are\ninstalled by default.\nTrying to install another plugin with a conflicting requirement may cause\nan error if the tree cannot be resolved correctly. For this reason, make\nsure your plugin requirement is as broad as possible, and not to lock it\ndown to specific patch versions.\nAssuming the host complies with semver, only changes\nin the host package's major version will break your plugin. Thus, if you've\nworked with every 1.x version of the host package, use \"^1.0\" or \"1.x\"\nto express this. If you depend on features introduced in 1.5.2, use\n\"^1.5.2\".\npeerDependenciesMeta\nWhen a user installs your package, npm will emit warnings if packages\nspecified in peerDependencies are not already installed. The\npeerDependenciesMeta field serves to provide npm more information on how\nyour peer dependencies are to be used. Specifically, it allows peer\ndependencies to be marked as optional.\nFor example:\n{\n  \"name\": \"tea-latte\",\n  \"version\": \"1.3.5\",\n  \"peerDependencies\": {\n    \"tea\": \"2.x\",\n    \"soy-milk\": \"1.2\"\n  },\n  \"peerDependenciesMeta\": {\n    \"soy-milk\": {\n      \"optional\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nMarking a peer dependency as optional ensures npm will not emit a warning\nif the soy-milk package is not installed on the host. This allows you to\nintegrate and interact with a variety of host packages without requiring\nall of them to be installed.\nbundledDependencies\nThis defines an array of package names that will be bundled when publishing\nthe package.\nIn cases where you need to preserve npm packages locally or have them\navailable through a single file download, you can bundle the packages in a\ntarball file by specifying the package names in the bundledDependencies\narray and executing npm pack.\nFor example:\nIf we define a package.json like this:\n{\n  \"name\": \"awesome-web-framework\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"bundledDependencies\": [\n    \"renderized\",\n    \"super-streams\"\n  ]\n}\n\nwe can obtain awesome-web-framework-1.0.0.tgz file by running npm pack.\nThis file contains the dependencies renderized and super-streams which\ncan be installed in a new project by executing npm install\nawesome-web-framework-1.0.0.tgz.  Note that the package names do not\ninclude any versions, as that information is specified in dependencies.\nIf this is spelled \"bundleDependencies\", then that is also honored.\noptionalDependencies\nIf a dependency can be used, but you would like npm to proceed if it cannot\nbe found or fails to install, then you may put it in the\noptionalDependencies object.  This is a map of package name to version or\nurl, just like the dependencies object.  The difference is that build\nfailures do not cause installation to fail.  Running npm install\n--no-optional will prevent these dependencies from being installed.\nIt is still your program's responsibility to handle the lack of the\ndependency.  For example, something like this:\ntry {\n  var foo = require('foo')\n  var fooVersion = require('foo/package.json').version\n} catch (er) {\n  foo = null\n}\nif ( notGoodFooVersion(fooVersion) ) {\n  foo = null\n}\n\n// .. then later in your program ..\n\nif (foo) {\n  foo.doFooThings()\n}\n\nEntries in optionalDependencies will override entries of the same name in\ndependencies, so it's usually best to only put in one place.\nengines\nYou can specify the version of node that your stuff works on:\n{\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"node\": \">=0.10.3 \nAnd, like with dependencies, if you don't specify the version (or if you\nspecify \"*\" as the version), then any version of node will do.\nYou can also use the \"engines\" field to specify which versions of npm are\ncapable of properly installing your program.  For example:\n{\n  \"engines\": {\n    \"npm\": \"~1.0.20\"\n  }\n}\n\nUnless the user has set the engine-strict config flag, this field is\nadvisory only and will only produce warnings when your package is installed\nas a dependency.\nos\nYou can specify which operating systems your\nmodule will run on:\n{\n  \"os\": [\n    \"darwin\",\n    \"linux\"\n  ]\n}\n\nYou can also block instead of allowing operating systems, just prepend the\nblocked os with a '!':\n{\n  \"os\": [\n    \"!win32\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThe host operating system is determined by process.platform\nIt is allowed to both block and allow an item, although there isn't any\ngood reason to do this.\ncpu\nIf your code only runs on certain cpu architectures,\nyou can specify which ones.\n{\n  \"cpu\": [\n    \"x64\",\n    \"ia32\"\n  ]\n}\n\nLike the os option, you can also block architectures:\n{\n  \"cpu\": [\n    \"!arm\",\n    \"!mips\"\n  ]\n}\n\nThe host architecture is determined by process.arch\nprivate\nIf you set \"private\": true in your package.json, then npm will refuse to\npublish it.\nThis is a way to prevent accidental publication of private repositories.\nIf you would like to ensure that a given package is only ever published to\na specific registry (for example, an internal registry), then use the\npublishConfig dictionary described below to override the registry\nconfig param at publish-time.\npublishConfig\nThis is a set of config values that will be used at publish-time. It's\nespecially handy if you want to set the tag, registry or access, so that\nyou can ensure that a given package is not tagged with \"latest\", published\nto the global public registry or that a scoped module is private by\ndefault.\nSee config to see the list of config options that\ncan be overridden.\nworkspaces\nThe optional workspaces field is an array of file patterns that describes\nlocations within the local file system that the install client should look\nup to find each workspace that needs to be\nsymlinked to the top level node_modules folder.\nIt can describe either the direct paths of the folders to be used as\nworkspaces or it can define globs that will resolve to these same folders.\nIn the following example, all folders located inside the folder\n./packages will be treated as workspaces as long as they have valid\npackage.json files inside them:\n{\n  \"name\": \"workspace-example\",\n  \"workspaces\": [\n    \"./packages/*\"\n  ]\n}\n\nSee workspaces for more examples.\nDEFAULT VALUES\nnpm will default some values based on package contents.\n\n\"scripts\": {\"start\": \"node server.js\"}\nIf there is a server.js file in the root of your package, then npm will\ndefault the start command to node server.js.\n\n\"scripts\":{\"install\": \"node-gyp rebuild\"}\nIf there is a binding.gyp file in the root of your package and you have\nnot defined an install or preinstall script, npm will default the\ninstall command to compile using node-gyp.\n\n\"contributors\": [...]\nIf there is an AUTHORS file in the root of your package, npm will treat\neach line as a Name  (url) format, where email and url are\noptional.  Lines which start with a # or are blank, will be ignored.\n\n\nSEE ALSO\n\nsemver\nworkspaces\nnpm init\nnpm version\nnpm config\nnpm help\nnpm install\nnpm publish\nnpm uninstall\n\n"}}}
